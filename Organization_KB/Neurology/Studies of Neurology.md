Abstract

Background: The cause of ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is usually trauma. Patients are relatively
young, since ankle trauma occurs at a relatively young age. Several conservative treatment
options are available, evidence of the benefits and harms of these options are lacking.

Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of any conservative treatment for ankle OA in
adults in order to provide a synthesis of the evidence as a base for future treatment guidelines.

Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL
2014, issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 up to 11 September 2014), EMBASE (1947 to September
2014), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2014), CINAHL (1985 to September 2014), PEDro (all years
till September 2014), AMED until September 2014, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials,
The Dutch Register. To identify potentially relevant studies we screened reference lists in
retrieved review articles and trials.

Selection criteria: We considered randomised or controlled clinical trials investigating any non-
surgical intervention for ankle OA for inclusion.

Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by
Cochrane.

Main results: No other RCT concerning any other conservative treatment besides the use of
hyaluronic acid (HA) for ankle OA was identified. Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were
included.A total of 240 participants diagnosed with ankle OA were included in this review. The
primary analysis included three RCTs (109 participants) which compared HA to placebo. One
study compared HA to exercise therapy, one compared HA combined with exercise therapy to
an intra-articular injection of botulinum toxin and one compared four different dosages of
HA.Primary analysis: a pooled analysis of two trials (45 participants) found that the Ankle

Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) total score (measuring pain and physical function) was reduced by
12% (95% CI -24% to -1%) at six months (mean difference (MD) -12.53 (95% CI -23.84 to -1.22)
on a scale of 0 to 100; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 4
(95% CI 2 to 205); this evidence was graded as low quality, due to limitations in study design
(unclear risk of selection bias for two studies and unclear risk for attrition bias for one study)
and imprecision of results: a small population size (45 participants). It is not known if a mean
difference of 12.53 points on a 100 point scale is clinically relevant. No minimal important
clinical difference is known for this score. Pain and function outcomes were not reported
separately. Radiographic joint structure changes were not investigated. For the mean quality of
life at six months (two trials; 45 participants) no meta-analysis could be performed due to
missing data. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were noted and no participants withdrew
because of an adverse event. There were a few adverse events (AEs) 5/63 (8%) in the HA group
and 2/46 (4%) in the placebo group. The Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) to have an adverse event was
2.34 higher compared to the control group (95% CI 0.45 to 12.11). This evidence is inconclusive
because of a wide CI and a small number of events.For comparing HA to exercise therapy (30
participants) the results for pain on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS 0 to 10) at 12 months are
inconclusive (MD 0.70, 95% CI -2.54 to 1.14). The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society
score (AOFAS score) was 13.10 points (MD) higher in favour of HA (95% CI 2.97 to 23.23) on a
scale of 0 to 100. The evidence was graded as low. No adverse events were found. Radiographic
structure changes were not measured; no participants withdrew due to AEs; no SAEs were
found.For the comparison of HA injection combined with exercise therapy to an intra-articular
injection of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) (75 participants), the outcome of the AOS pain score of
the affected joint at six months is inconclusive (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.62). The physical
function (the AOS disability score) at six months is inconclusive (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.74).
The same number of AEs were found in both groups; HA 2/37 (5.9%), BoNT-A 2/38 (5.8%) (risk
ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.91). Radiographic changes were not examined, no SAEs were
found and no participants withdrew because of an AE. The evidence was graded as low.The RCT
comparing four different dosing schedules for HA (26 participants) showed the best median
decrease in pain on walking VAS (on a scale of 0 to 100) for 3 x 1 ml at 27 weeks with a median
decrease of 30. Physical function, radiographic changes and quality of life were not
measured.Twenty-seven percent of all participants had AEs, most of them in the 2ml group
(57% in this group). No participants withdrew due to an AE and no SAEs were noted.Overall the
quality of the evidence showed some serious limitations. The evidence was graded low for the
primary analysis comparing HA to placebo. This was based on a limitation in design and
implementation: sample sizes were small (45 to 92 participants) and and imprecision in results:
there was an unclear risk of bias for several items concerning the three studies used in the meta
analysis.

Authors' conclusions: Currently, there is insufficient data to create a synthesis of the evidence
as a base for future guidelines for ankle OA. Since the aetiology of ankle OA is different,
guidelines that are currently used for hip and knee OA may not be applicable for ankle OA.
Simple analgesics as recommended for hip and knee OA seem however a reasonable first step
to treat ankle OA. It is unclear if there is a benefit or harm for HA as treatment for ankle OA
compared to placebo at six months based on a low quality of evidence. Inconclusive results
were found comparing HA to other treatments. HA can be conditionally recommended if
patients have an inadequate response to simple analgesics. It remains unclear which patients
(age, grade of ankle OA) benefit the most from HA injections and which dosage schedule should
be used.

Abstract

Background: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic
predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or
both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for
psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms.
Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic

treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments
remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head,
which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis.

Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small
molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-
analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

Search methods: For this living systematic review we updated our searches of the following
databases monthly to September 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers to the same date. We
checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further
references to eligible RCTs.

Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults (over 18
years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had
been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in
comparison to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the
proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation),
and the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase. We
did not evaluate differences in specific adverse events.

Data collection and analysis: Several groups of two review authors independently undertook
study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the
data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest
and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and
acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse events). We assessed the certainty of the body of
evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes and all comparisons, according to
CINeMA, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data
were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to
infer on treatment hierarchy: 0% (treatment is the worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100%
(treatment is the best for effectiveness or safety).

Main results: We included 158 studies (18 new studies for the update) in our review (57,831
randomised participants, 67.2% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). The overall average age
was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these
studies were placebo-controlled (58%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-
armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 20
treatments. In all, 133 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes

included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks
after randomisation). We assessed many studies (53/158) as being at high risk of bias; 25 were
at an unclear risk, and 80 at low risk. Most studies (123/158) declared funding by a
pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report their source of funding. Network meta-
analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small
molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in reaching
PASI 90. At class level, in reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-
IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the
non-biological systemic agents. At drug level, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab,
risankizumab and guselkumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than
ustekinumab and three anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept.
Ustekinumab and adalimumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than
etanercept; ustekinumab was more effective than certolizumab, and the clinical effectiveness of
ustekinumab and adalimumab was similar. There was no significant difference between
tofacitinib or apremilast and three non-biological drugs: fumaric acid esters (FAEs), ciclosporin
and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab,
risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and brodalumab outperformed other
drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness of these drugs
was similar, except for ixekizumab which had a better chance of reaching PASI 90 compared with
secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab. The clinical effectiveness of these seven drugs was:
infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 50.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.96 to 120.67,
SUCRA = 93.6; high-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 32.48, 95% CI 27.13 to
38.87; SUCRA = 90.5; high-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.76, 95% CI
23.96 to 34.54; SUCRA = 84.6; high-certainty evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64,
95% CI 3.72 to 923.86; SUCRA = 81.4; high-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo):
RR 25.79, 95% CI 21.61 to 30.78; SUCRA = 76.2; high-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus
placebo): RR 25.52, 95% CI 21.25 to 30.64; SUCRA = 75; high-certainty evidence; and
brodalumab (versus placebo): RR 23.55, 95% CI 19.48 to 28.48; SUCRA = 68.4; moderate-
certainty evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab (as
well as mirikizumab, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, and
methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few trials. We found no
significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs.
Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to
moderate certainty for all the comparisons. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution
and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global
Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality
of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions.

Authors' conclusions: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab,
ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab were the
most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on
the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction
therapy (outcomes were measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient
for evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low
numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years)
and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in
daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and
sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a
reliable risk profile of treatments. We found no significant difference in the assessed
interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, and the evidence for all the interventions was of
low to moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the
treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies
and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future research,
randomised trials directly comparing active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of
benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between non-
biological systemic agents and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus
anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should
also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve participants,
baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure
harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and
long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different
agents. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new
approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant
new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews for the current status of this review.

Abstract

Background: Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. It
seriously impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, especially for those with moderate to
severe eczema. Various treatments allow sustained control of the disease; however, their
relative benefit remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing
treatments.

Objectives: To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic
immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate
rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their
efficacy and safety.

Search methods: We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin
Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase.

Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents
for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible
eczema treatment.

Data collection and analysis: We synthesised data using pair-wise analysis and NMA to compare
treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. Effectiveness was assessed primarily
by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient-Oriented Eczema
Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants
with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. We deemed short-term follow-up as ≤ 16
weeks and long-term follow-up as > 16 weeks. We assessed the certainty of the body of
evidence from the NMA for these primary outcomes using six domains of CiNEMA grading.

Main results: We included a total of 74 studies, with 8177 randomised participants.
Approximately 55% of participants were male, with average age of 32 years (range 2 to 84
years), although age and gender were unreported for 419 and 902 participants, respectively.
Most of the included trials were placebo controlled (65%), 34% were head-to-head studies (15%
assessed the effects of different doses of the same drug), and 1% were multi-armed studies with
both an active comparator and a placebo. All trials included participants with moderate to
severe eczema, but 62% of studies did not separate data by severity; 38% of studies assessed
only severe eczema. The total duration of included trials ranged from 2 weeks to 60 months,
whereas treatment duration varied from a single dose (CIM331, KPL-716) to 60 months
(methotrexate (MTX)). Seventy studies were available for quantitative synthesis; this review
assessed 29 immunosuppressive agents from three classes of interventions. These included (1)

conventional treatments, with ciclosporin assessed most commonly; (2) small molecule
treatments, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and (3) biological treatments, including anti-CD31 receptors, anti-
interleukin (IL)-22, anti-IL-31, anti-IL-13, anti-IL-12/23p40, anti-OX40, anti-TSLP, anti-CRTH2, and
anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibodies, but most commonly dupilumab. Most trials
(73) assessed outcomes at a short-term duration ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, whereas 33 trials
assessed long-term outcomes, with duration ranging from 5 to 60 months. All participants were
from a hospital setting. Fifty-two studies declared a source of funding, and of these,
pharmaceutical companies funded 88%. We rated 37 studies as high risk; 21, unclear risk, and
16, low risk of bias, with studies most commonly at high risk of attrition bias. Network meta-
analysis suggests that dupilumab ranks first for effectiveness when compared with other
biological treatments. Dupilumab is more effective than placebo in achieving EASI75 (risk ratio
(RR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 3.69) and improvement in POEM score (mean
difference 7.30, 95% CI 6.61 to 8.00) at short-term follow-up (high-certainty evidence). Very
low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the effects of dupilumab when compared
with placebo, in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve EASI75 (RR 2.59, 95% CI
1.87 to 3.60) at longer-term follow-up. Low-certainty evidence indicates that tralokinumab may
be more effective than placebo in achieving short-term EASI75 (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.34),
but there was no evidence for tralokinumab to allow us to assess short-term follow-up of POEM
or long-term follow-up of EASI75. We are uncertain of the effect of ustekinumab compared with
placebo in achieving EASI75 (long-term follow-up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.45; short-term
follow-up: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.97; both very low certainty). We found no evidence on
ustekinumab for the POEM outcome. We are uncertain whether other immunosuppressive
agents that targeted our key outcomes influence the achievement of short-term EASI75
compared with placebo due to low- or very low-certainty evidence. Dupilumab and
ustekinumab were the only immunosuppressive agents evaluated for longer-term EASI75.
Dupilumab was the only agent evaluated for improvement in POEM during short-term follow-
up. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence indicates a lower proportion of participants with SAEs
after treatment with QAW039 and dupilumab compared to placebo during short-term follow-
up, but low- to very low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in SAEs during short-term
follow-up of other immunosuppressive agents compared to placebo. Evidence for effects of
immunosuppressive agents on risk of any infection during short-term follow-up and SAEs during
long-term follow-up compared with placebo was of low or very low certainty but did not
indicate a difference. We did not identify differences in other adverse events (AEs), but
dupilumab is associated with specific AEs, including eye inflammation and eosinophilia.

Authors' conclusions: Our findings indicate that dupilumab is the most effective biological
treatment for eczema. Compared to placebo, dupilumab reduces eczema signs and symptoms in

the short term for people with moderate to severe atopic eczema. Short-term safety outcomes
from clinical trials did not reveal new safety concerns with dupilumab. Overall, evidence for the
efficacy of most other immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe atopic eczema is
of low or very low certainty. Given the lack of data comparing conventional with newer
biological treatments for the primary outcomes, there remains high uncertainty for ranking the
efficacy and safety of conventional treatments such as ciclosporin and biological treatments
such as dupilumab. Most studies were placebo-controlled and assessed only short-term efficacy
of immunosuppressive agents. Further adequately powered head-to-head RCTs should evaluate
comparative long-term efficacy and safety of available treatments for moderate to severe
eczema.

Abstract

Background: Approximately, 10% of people report a penicillin allergy; however, more than 90%
can safely undergo delabeling after a detailed history, oral challenge, or other investigations
such as penicillin skin testing (PST). Although PST is the gold standard, the results can be
heterogeneous, and awaiting specialist assessment may take an inordinate amount of time.
Therefore, oral provocation challenge has become acceptable for individuals with low-risk
penicillin allergy histories. There also appears to be an association with increased prevalence of
adverse drug reaction reporting in female individuals, which may translate to penicillin allergy
prevalence; however, the evidence has not been assessed through a sex and gender lens. This
systematic review will identify and synthesize the findings from studies that report measures of

effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at delabeling penicillin allergies in low-risk
individuals. Information related to sex and gender will be extracted, where available, to
understand potential differences in allergy reporting and patient outcomes.

Methods: The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Centre for
Review and Dissemination's Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care will be used as
frameworks for conducting this systematic review. The literature search will be conducted by a
medical librarian (B. M. M.) and will consist of a search strategy to identify and retrieve
published studies that meet our inclusion criteria. Studies that require penicillin skin testing
(PST) as a step prior to other interventions will be excluded. Integrated knowledge translation
involving co-design was carried out for this systematic review protocol creation. Data extraction
will be conducted at four levels: (1) study level, (2) patient level, (3) intervention level, and (4)
outcome level. A narrative descriptive synthesis of results and risk of bias of all included studies
will be provided, and, if relevant, a meta-analysis will be performed.

Discussion: The dissemination of findings from this knowledge synthesis to various stakeholders
is intended to inform on options for evidence-based interventions to aid in delabeling penicillin
allergies in individuals with a low risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction. Detailed
reporting on the characteristics of delabeling interventions as well as the effectiveness of similar
interventions will benefit policy makers considering the implementation of a penicillin allergy
delabeling protocol. Additionally, findings from this systematic review will report on the current
evidence regarding the role of sex and gender in both the prevalence and outcomes associated
with the presence of penicillin allergies.

Abstract

Background: Oral challenges with amoxicillin or other penicillins are safe and effective for
delabeling low-risk penicillin allergy histories. While approximately 90% of reported penicillin
allergies can be safely delabeled, detailed data on reaction frequency, types, and timing during
and after delabeling interventions remain limited. Such data are crucial to optimizing protocols
and integrating oral challenges into routine practice. This study aims to characterize the
interventions commonly used for oral challenge, classify reported reactions, and identify
reported predictors of hypersensitivity reactions in randomized controlled trials and quasi-
experimental studies involving an oral challenge for patients with low-risk penicillin
allergies. Methods: This study leverages data from a systematic review and meta-analysis
assessing the effectiveness of oral challenge interventions in patients with low-risk penicillin
allergies. This descriptive analysis summarizes the adverse reactions experienced among
patients in published studies who received oral challenge. Participant demographics,
intervention protocols, frequency, type, and timing of post-challenge adverse reactions are
reported. Reactions are categorized as immediate, delayed, or other, with frequencies
summarized using descriptive statistics. A random effects meta-analysis quantifies a pooled
adverse reaction rate. Predictors of hypersensitivity reactions were synthesized
narratively. Results: Across 26 studies (2 randomized trials, 24 quasi-experimental studies)
evaluating an oral challenge for patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy, the average participant
age was 56 years, with a predominance of females (61%) and limited ethnic diversity with 88%
reported or identifying as White. Amoxicillin was the most frequenty used oral challenge agent,
typically administered as a single 250 mg oral dose. The incidence of reaction or non-delabeling
was 4% (95% Confidence Interval 3%, 6%), I 2 = 43%, P = .0001. Cutaneous manifestations, such
as rashes, were the most frequent reactions. Delayed reactions, primarily mild maculopapular
rashes, were uncommon and managed with antihistamines or topical steroids. Risk factors for
oral challenge reactions included higher baseline allergy burden and shorter intervals to oral
challenge since the index reaction. Conclusion: Oral challenge strategies to delabel low-risk
penicillin allergies can involve single doses of amoxicillin or other penicillins with monitoring
protocols that can be managed in ambulatory settings. However, although these delabeling
strategies are becoming more prevalent, continued study of standardized protocols and follow-
up are essential for effective and replicable delabeling strategies. Future research should
prioritize diverse populations and equity-driven frameworks to improve generalizability to all
individuals and to resource limited settings.

Abstract

Background: Ten percent of the population is labeled as allergic to penicillin(s), when in fact
90% of these labels are inappropriate. Recent studies have shown that inpatient delabeling by a
direct drug challenge (dDC) is safe in low-risk patients. However, there is a need for outpatient
and nonallergist delabeling.

Objective: To assess the safety of delabeling low-risk adults by means of dDC in primary care.

Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception
to March 15, 2022 (updated June 5, 2023) for studies performing dDC in adults in primary care
or other outpatient settings. Two researchers independently screened studies for eligibility. The
data extraction and critical appraisal were performed by 1 reviewer, and we pooled the results
in a meta-analysis.

Results: Of 2138 results, 12 studies (1070 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Three studies
evaluated delabeling in primary care and 9 studies in an outpatient hospital setting. There were
no critical adverse events during dDC. No reaction occurred in 97.13% of the 1070 patients, who
previously labeled as penicillin-allergic, and were safely delabeled. Ten patients (<1%)
developed an immediate reaction: 3 had self-limiting reactions and 7 needed antihistaminics,
steroids, epinephrine, and/or salbutamol.

Conclusions: No serious allergic reactions are observed during direct amoxicillin challenge in
adults in an outpatient setting. However, with the exception of 1 recent report, these studies
are of low to moderate quality. Nonspecialist delabeling is promising, but further research is
required on correct risk stratification and safety assessment in large cohort studies evaluating
dDC in primary care.

Abstract

Background: Antibiotic allergy labels are important barriers to treatment and antimicrobial
stewardship, but their prevalence in UK hospitals is poorly described.

Objective: To ascertain the prevalence and characteristics of antibiotic allergy labels in a large
UK hospital setting and estimate the proportion of penicillin allergy labels for which point-of-
care (POC) delabeling assessment would be appropriate.

Methods: Electronic health records data were analyzed from all patients treated at Cambridge
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in 2019. Validated POC delabeling risk stratification
criteria were retrospectively applied to penicillin allergy labels.

Results: Recorded reactions to antibiotics were present in 11.8% of all patients (32,148 of
273,216), 16.3% of inpatients (13,874 of 85,230), and 9.7% of outpatients (18,274 of 187,986).
Penicillins were the commonest reaction precipitant described (9.0% of patients; 24,646 of
273,216), followed by sulfonamides/trimethoprim (1.4%; 3869 of 273,216) and
macrolides/lincosamides (1.3%; 3644 of 273,216). A total of 3.9% of inpatients had recorded
reactions to >1 antibiotic class (3348 of 85,230). Cutaneous manifestations were the most
commonly described reaction features (40.7% of labels; 15,821 of 38,902). Of 15,949 labels
describing probable or possible penicillin "allergy" with sufficient detail to allow for the
retrospective assessment of POC delabeling suitability, 1702 were deemed suitable for removal
or downgrading of the label to "intolerance" without further investigation (10.7%), 11,887 were
appropriate for POC assessment using an oral penicillin challenge (OPC) or OPC with prior
bedside skin testing (74.5%), and 2360 were identified as unsuitable for any form of POC
assessment (14.8%).

Conclusions: Antibiotic allergy labels are highly prevalent in a UK hospital setting. A large
proportion of penicillin allergy labels may be suitable for POC delabeling assessment.

Abstract

Background: Even though 8%-25% of most populations studied globally are labeled as penicillin
allergic, most diagnoses of penicillin allergy are made in childhood and relate to events that are
either not allergic in nature, are low risk for immediate hypersensitivity, or are a potential true
allergy that has waned over time. Penicillin allergy labels directly impact antimicrobial
stewardship by leading to use of less effective and broader spectrum antimicrobials and are
associated with antimicrobial resistance. They may also delay appropriate antimicrobial therapy
and lead to increased risk of specific adverse healthcare outcomes. Operationalizing penicillin
allergy de-labeling into a new arm of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) has become an
increasing global focus.

Methods: We performed an evidence-based narrative review of the literature of penicillin
allergy label carriage, the adverse effects of penicillin allergy labels, and current approaches and
barriers to penicillin allergy de-labeling. Over the period 1928-2018 in Pubmed and Medline,
search terms used included "penicillin allergy" or "penicillin hypersensitivity" alone or in
combination with "adverse events," "testing," "evaluation," "effects," "label," "de-labeling,"
"prick or epicutaneous," and "intradermal" skin testing, "oral challenge or provocation," "cross-
reactivity," and "antimicrobial stewardship".

Results: Penicillin allergy labels are highly prevalent, largely inaccurate and their carriage may
lead to unnecessary treatment and inferior outcomes with alternative agents as well as adverse
public health outcomes such as antibiotic resistance.

Conclusions: Operationalizing penicillin allergy de-labeling as an aspect of ASP has become an
increasing global focus. There is a need for validated approaches that optimally combine the use
of history and ingestion challenge with or without proceeding formal skin testing to tackle
penicillin allergy efficiently within complex healthcare systems. At the same time, there is great
promise for penicillin allergy evaluation and de-labeling as an individual and public health

strategy to reduce adverse healthcare outcomes, improve antimicrobial stewardship, and
decrease healthcare costs.

Diagnosis and clinical management of drug allergies in obstetrics and gynecology: an expert
review

Abstract

Drug allergies, specifically antibiotic allergies, are frequently encountered in obstetrics and
gynecology, with 10% of the US population reporting a penicillin allergy. This poses a particular
challenge to the obstetrician-gynecologist, as beta-lactam antibiotics are indicated as first-line
therapy for the treatment and prevention of most specialty-specific infections. Alternative
antibiotic use in the setting of a reported allergy is not benign and has been associated with
increased cesarean delivery, endometritis, wound complication, length of hospital stay in
pregnant patients, Group B Streptococcus sepsis, neonatal length of stay, neonatal laboratory
draw in neonates born to patients with allergies, and surgical site infection in gynecologic
patients. Furthermore, alternative antibiotic use leads to increased antibiotic resistance, toxicity,
and healthcare cost. In addition, the administration of antibiotics in a patient with a history of
type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction poses a risk of anaphylaxis with repeat exposure.
Fortunately, >90% of patients who report a penicillin allergy are not truly allergic and would
tolerate penicillins if administered. This can be due to either mislabeling of the index reaction as
an allergy (when it was due to a drug intolerance or a viral exanthem) or waning
immunoglobulin E-mediated immunity over time. Given this, allergy evaluation is widely
recommended, even in pregnancy. Allergy evaluation involves detailed patient history and
allergy testing with skin testing and/or oral challenge, as appropriate. These tools have been
found to be safe and effective in gravid and nongravid individuals and to result in increased use
of first-line antibiotics when used appropriately. Furthermore, even in the setting of a true
penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with cephalosporins is extremely low and estimated at 2% to
3% among patients with a verified penicillin allergy and considerably lower than this among
patients with an unverified penicillin allergy. Guidelines support the routine use of
cephalosporins without testing or additional precautions in patients with an unverified

nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy and the routine use of structurally dissimilar cephalosporins
(specifically Ancef) even in patients with an anaphylactic penicillin allergy. In cases in which
there is no appropriate alternative antibiotic than that for which the patient is allergic, such as
syphilis in a pregnant patient with penicillin allergy, desensitization can be performed. This
process involves temporary induction of drug tolerance through exposure to small amounts of
the allergen until a therapeutic dose is achieved and has been safely performed in pregnancy.
Desensitization requires expert supervision and is most often performed in the intensive care
setting with a multidisciplinary team. The other 2 most common antibiotic allergies
encountered in the field of obstetrics and gynecology are cephalosporin and metronidazole
allergies. Cephalosporin allergies are managed similarly to penicillin allergies with readily
available skin testing and oral challenge. Skin testing for metronidazole allergy lacks sensitivity
and specificity, and thus, oral challenge or desensitization procedure is the preferred approach
for low-risk and high-risk patients, respectively. When it comes to drug allergies, specifically
antibiotic allergies, the role of the obstetrician-gynecologist is to identify patients with reported
allergies and to refer patients to a specialist for further evaluation as soon as possible. Allergy
evaluation using a detailed patient history and allergy testing (skin testing and/or oral challenge)
when indicated has been shown to be safe and effective and is an important part of antibiotic
stewardship.

Abstract

Background: Generalized joint laxity (GJL) may affect chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI)
treatment. Short-term results of the arthroscopic-assisted modified Karlsson technique in CLAI
were compared for GJL and non-GJL cases.

Methods: This retrospective analysis included 75 CLAI patients admitted to Jincheng People's
Hospital from August 2019 to August 2023. Patients were diagnosed with CLAI based on clinical
history, physical examination, and imaging findings. Twenty-five patients had concomitant GJL
(hypermobile group), while fifty did not (non-hypermobile group). Both groups underwent

arthroscopic-assisted modified Karlsson surgery. General characteristics and joint function were
compared 6 months postoperatively. Ankle function was assessed using the anterior drawer test
(ADT), AOFAS ankle score, and Karlsson score before and after surgery.

Results: Preoperative ADT displacement was similar between groups (9.8 ± 1.9 vs. 9.5 ± 1.7 mm,
P = 0.51), but at 6 months postoperatively, the hypermobile group exhibited greater residual
laxity (4.2 ± 1.3 vs. 2.8 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.001). Functional scores improved significantly in both
groups (P < 0.05), though the hypermobile group had lower final AOFAS (82.4 ± 6.3 vs. 88.1 ±
5.7, P = 0.003) and Karlsson scores (80.5 ± 7.2 vs. 86.3 ± 6.8, P = 0.004) compared to
controls.hypermobile group.

Conclusion: All patients had increased ankle function and clinical efficacy after the arthroscopy-
assisted modified Karlsson treatment. Concomitant GJL patients had worse short-term results
than those without GJL.

Abstract

in English, Chinese

Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of the suture anchor technique without knots for
reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) combined with the reinforcement of
the inferior extensor retinaculum in treating chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI).

Methods: The clinical data of 31 patients with CLAI who were admitted between August 2017
and December 2023 and met the selection criteria were retrospectively analyzed. There were
18 males and 13 females, with an age range from 20 to 48 years (mean, 34.6 years). All patients
had a history of repeated ankle sprain, with a disease duration of 6-18 months (mean, 9.65
months). The anterior drawer test and inversion stress test were positive, and tenderness was
present in the ligament area. Stress X-ray films of the ankle joint showed a talar tilt angle of
(10.00±2.78)° and an anterior talar displacement of (9.48±1.96) mm on the affected side. MRI
revealed discontinuity, tortuosity, or disappearance of the ATFL structure. Preoperatively, the
visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 5.2±2.1, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle
Society (AOFAS) score was 62.9±7.1. All patients underwent arthroscopic debridement of the
ankle joint followed by reconstruction of the ATFL using the suture anchor technique without
knots combined with reinforcement of the inferior extensor retinaculum. Postoperatively, pain
and function were assessed using the VAS and AOFAS scores. Stress X-ray films were taken to
measure the talar tilt angle and anterior talar displacement to evaluate changes in ankle joint
stability. Patient satisfaction was assessed according to the Insall criteria.

Results: All 31 surgeries were successfully completed. One case had wound exudation, while the
remaining surgical incisions healed by first intention. Two cases experienced numbness on the
lateral aspect of the foot, which disappeared within 1 month after operation. All patients were
followed up 15-84 months (mean, 47.2 months). No complication such as anchor loosening,
recurrent lateral ankle instability, superficial peroneal nerve injury, rejection reaction, or wound
infection occurred postoperatively. The anterior drawer test and inversion stress test were
negative at 3 months after operation. Stress X-ray films taken at 3 months after operation
showed the talar tilt angle of (2.86±1.72)° and the anterior talar displacement of (2.97±1.32)
mm, both of which were significantly different from the preoperative values
( t=12.218, P<0.001; t=15.367, P<0.001). At last follow-up, 2 patients had ankle swelling after
exercise, which resolved spontaneously with rest; all 31 patients returned to their pre-injury
level of sports or had no significant discomfort in daily activities. At last follow-up, 25 patients
were pain-free, 4 had mild pain after exercise, and 2 had mild pain after walking more than 2
000 meters. The VAS score was 0.8±0.9 and the AOFAS score was 91.6±4.1, both of which were

significantly different from the preoperative scores ( t=10.851, P<0.001; t=-19.514, P<0.001).
According to the Insall criteria, 24 patients were rated as excellent, 4 as good, and 3 as fair, with
a satisfaction rate of 90.3%.

Conclusion: The suture anchor technique without knots for reconstruction of the ATFL
combined with reinforcement of the inferior extensor retinaculum provides satisfactory short-
and mid-term effectiveness in treating CLAI.

Abstract

Background: To analyze the feasibility and clinical results of the modified Broström operation
(MBO) combined with suture tape augmentation under arthroscopy for chronic lateral ankle
instability (CLAI) in patients with generalized joint laxity (GJL).

Methods: From October 2019 to October 2021, a total of 111 patients (111 ankles) treated with
MBO combined with suture tape augmentation under arthroscope were retrospectively divided
into a GJL group (29 patients) and a control group (82 patients). Mechanical stability of the
affected ankle joint was evaluated radiographically preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively,
and the last follow-up. Complications and surgical failures, as well as visual analog scale (VAS)
score, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and the Karlsson score were also recorded.
All statistical analyses were completed using SPSS 20.0.

Results: The average follow-up time was 21.7 ± 5.2 months for the GJL group, and 20.9 ± 5.3
months for the control group. Pain and symptoms in both groups were effectively relieved by
the procedure reflected by decreased VAS scores, improved FAAM and Karlsson scores at 6
months postoperatively, and the final follow-up (P < .05). Preoperative talar tilt angle and
anterior talar translation were significantly greater in the GJL group than those in the control
group (P < .05). Postoperatively, both talar tilt angle and anterior talar translation were reduced
in both groups at 6 months postoperatively and the last follow-up (P < .05), and we found no
significant difference between the two groups (P > .05). Furthermore, we found no significant

difference in VAS, FAAM, and Karlsson scores between the 2 groups 6 months postoperatively
and at the last follow-up.

Conclusion: Arthroscopic MBO combined with suture tape augmentation is a reliable procedure
for treating CLAI with GJL. At short-term follow-up, we found that the GJL group achieved an
equivalent level of stability compared with the control group.

Abstract

Purpose: To compare the short-term clinical outcomes of the open versus arthroscopic modified
Broström procedure in generalized joint laxity (GJL) patients.

Methods: From January 2018 to January 2020, 64 consecutive patients with chronic lateral
ankle instability (CLAI) and GJL (Beighton score ≥ 4) were prospectively enrolled into two groups:
those who underwent the open modified Broström procedure (open group, n = 32) and those
who underwent the arthroscopic modified Broström procedure (arthroscopic group, n = 32).
Patients underwent an open or arthroscopic modified Broström procedure based on the time
when they attended the clinic for consultation. All patients were followed-up at 3, 6, 12, and 24
months postoperatively. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analogue scale
(VAS), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and Karlsson score, and the
radiographic outcomes were assessed using stress radiography at 24 months postoperatively.
The time to return to work and the failure rate were also evaluated and compared.

Results: Follow-up was completed for 31 patients in the open group and 30 patients in the
arthroscopic group. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of
demographic characteristics, Beighton score (6.2 ± 1.9 vs. 5.5 ± 1.4, n.s.), or duration of
symptoms. There were no significant differences in the functional scores before surgery and at

6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively or in the mean anterior translation of the talus and talar
tilt angle on stress radiography at 24 months postoperatively between the open and
arthroscopic groups. Compared to the open group, the arthroscopic group showed a
significantly earlier return to work (6.8 ± 2.1 vs. 8.1 ± 2.4 weeks, p = 0.006). There was no
significant difference in terms of the failure rate between the open and arthroscopic groups
(16.1% vs. 23.3%, n.s.).

Conclusion: Arthroscopic modified Broström procedure achieved similar short-term outcomes
to the open procedure for GJL patients. Arthroscopic modified Broström procedure showed an
earlier return to work than the open modified Broström procedure and was an alternative to
open surgery for CLAI patients with GJL.

Abstract

Purpose: To determine the best surgical treatment for chronic ankle instability (CAI) a
systematic review was performed to compare the functional outcomes between various surgical
stabilization methods.

Methods: A systematic search was performed from 1950 up to April 2016 using PubMed,
EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 18 years,
persistent lateral ankle instability, treatment by some form of surgical stabilization, described
functional outcome measures. Exclusion criteria were case reports, (systematic) reviews, articles
not published in English, description of only acute instability or only conservative treatment,
medial ankle instability and concomitant injuries, deformities or previous surgical treatment for
ankle instability. After inclusion, studies were critically appraised using the Modified Coleman
Methodology Score.

Results: The search resulted in a total of 19 articles, including 882 patients, which were included
in this review. The Modified Coleman Methodology Score ranged from 30 to 73 points on a scale
from 0 to 90 points. The AOFAS and Karlsson Score were the most commonly used patient-
reported outcome measures to assess functional outcome after surgery. Anatomic repair
showed the highest post-operative scores [AOFAS 93.8 (SD ± 2.7; n = 119); Karlsson 95.1 (SD ±
3.6, n = 121)], compared to anatomic reconstruction [AOFAS 90.2 (SD ± 10.9, n = 128); Karlsson
90.1 (SD ± 7.8, n = 35)] and tenodesis [AOFAS 86.5 (SD ± 12.0, n = 10); Karlsson 85.3 (SD ± 2.5, n
= 39)]. Anatomic reconstruction showed the highest score increase after surgery (AOFAS 37.0
(SD ± 6.8, n = 128); Karlsson 51.6 (SD ± 5.5, n = 35) compared to anatomic repair [AOFAS 31.8
(SD ± 5.3, n = 119); Karlsson 40.9 (SD ± 2.9, n = 121)] and tenodesis [AOFAS 19.5 (SD ± 13.7, n =
10); Karlsson 29.4 (SD ± 6.3, n = 39)] (p < 0.005).

Conclusion: Anatomic reconstruction and anatomic repair provide better functional outcome
after surgical treatment of patients with CAI compared to tenodesis reconstruction. These
results further discourage the use of tenodesis reconstruction and other non-anatomic surgical
techniques. Future studies may be required to indicate potential value of tenodesis
reconstruction when used as a salvage procedure. Not optimal, but the latter still provides an
increase in functional outcome post-operatively. Anatomic reconstruction seems to give the
best results, but may be more invasive than anatomic repair. This has to be kept in mind when
choosing between reconstruction and repair in the treatment of CAI.

Abstract

Background: To improve ankle stability in patients who have experienced an ankle sprain with
residual symptoms of instability and/or objective joint laxity, external supports (such as taping,
bracing, and orthotic insoles) are used sometimes. However, available randomized trials have

disagreed on whether restraints improve balance in those individuals. In this situation, a
network meta-analysis can help because it allows for comparing multiple treatments
simultaneously, taking advantage not only of direct but also indirect evidence synthesis.

Questions/purposes: The aim of this network meta-analysis was to assess (1) the impact of
taping and orthotic devices on dynamic postural control in individuals with ankle instability and
(2) the presence of a placebo effect in participants treated with sham taping and complications
resulting from the administered treatments.

Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases up to February 13, 2019
for completed studies. Randomized trials assessing the results of real and/or sham taping, wait-
and-see protocols, ankle bracing, and foot orthotics for ankle instability as determined by one
or more ankle sprains followed by ongoing subjective symptoms and/or mechanical laxity were
included. We evaluated dynamic postural control in terms of the Star Excursion Balance Test in
the posteromedial direction (SEBT-PM), which is considered the most representative of balance
deficits in patients with ankle instability. Standardized mean differences were re-expressed to
percentage differences in SEBT-PM, with higher scores representing possible improvement.
Subsequently, those data were checked against the established minimal detectable change of
14% for this scale to make judgements on clinical importance. We also assessed the presence of
a placebo effect by comparing the results of sham taping with no treatment and complications
resulting from the administered treatments. Additionally, we judged the quality of trials using
the Cochrane risk of bias tool and quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. A total of 22 trials met our
inclusion criteria, 18 of which were deemed to be at a low risk of bias. A network of treatments
consisting of 13 studies was created, and the level of evidence was judged to be high. As far as
participants' allocation to treatment arms, 85 patients followed a wait-and-see protocol, 29
received placebo taping, 99 were treated with taping, 16 were treated with bracing, 27 were
administered insoles, and six individuals were offered a combination of insoles with bracing. Of
note, with statistical power set at 80%, a minimum of 16 patients per treatment group was
required to provide sufficient statistical power and detect a SEBT-PM percentage difference of
14%.

Results: A network meta-analysis did not demonstrate a benefit of taping or bracing over no
treatment (percentage difference in SEBT-PM between taping and bracing versus control: -2.4
[95% CI -6 to 1.1]; p = 0.18, and -7.5 [95% CI -15.9 to 1]; p = 0.08, respectively). This was also the
case for sham taping because the measurement increase failed to exceed the minimal
detectable change (percentage difference in SEBT-PM between sham taping and untreated
control: -1.1 [95% CI -6.9 to 4.7]; p = 0.72). Importantly, there were no reported adverse events
after treatment application.

Conclusions: Evidence of moderate strength indicated that external supports of any type were
no more effective than controls in improving dynamic postural control in patients with at least
one ankle sprain and residual functional or mechanical deficits. Therefore, implementing those
tools as a standalone treatment does not appear to be a viable strategy for the primary
management of ankle instability. It is conceivable that combinations of rehabilitation and
external supports could be more effective than external supports alone, and future trials should
evaluate the potential of such combinations in enhancing not only clinician-reported but also
patient-oriented outcomes using long-term follow-up measurements.

Abstract

Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect of
anaesthesia and surgery. Up to 80% of patients may be affected. These outcomes are a major
cause of patient dissatisfaction and may lead to prolonged hospital stay and higher costs of care
along with more severe complications. Many antiemetic drugs are available for prophylaxis.
They have various mechanisms of action and side effects, but there is still uncertainty about
which drugs are most effective with the fewest side effects.

Objectives: • To compare the efficacy and safety of different prophylactic pharmacologic
interventions (antiemetic drugs) against no treatment, against placebo, or against each other (as
monotherapy or combination prophylaxis) for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting
in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia • To generate a clinically
useful ranking of antiemetic drugs (monotherapy and combination prophylaxis) based on

efficacy and safety • To identify the best dose or dose range of antiemetic drugs in terms of
efficacy and safety SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature (CINAHL), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. The first
search was performed in November 2017 and was updated in April 2020. In the update of the
search, 39 eligible studies were found that were not included in the analysis (listed as awaiting
classification).

Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effectiveness or side effects of
single antiemetic drugs in any dose or combination against each other or against an inactive
control in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. All antiemetic drugs
belonged to one of the following substance classes: 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists, D₂ receptor
antagonists, NK₁ receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. No
language restrictions were applied. Abstract publications were excluded.

Data collection and analysis: A review team of 11 authors independently assessed trials for
inclusion and risk of bias and subsequently extracted data. We performed pair-wise meta-
analyses for drugs of direct interest (amisulpride, aprepitant, casopitant, dexamethasone,
dimenhydrinate, dolasetron, droperidol, fosaprepitant, granisetron, haloperidol, meclizine,
methylprednisolone, metoclopramide, ondansetron, palonosetron, perphenazine,
promethazine, ramosetron, rolapitant, scopolamine, and tropisetron) compared to placebo
(inactive control). We performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) to estimate the relative effects
and ranking (with placebo as reference) of all available single drugs and combinations. Primary
outcomes were vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively, serious adverse events (SAEs), and
any adverse event (AE). Secondary outcomes were drug class-specific side effects (e.g.
headache), mortality, early and late vomiting, nausea, and complete response. We performed
subgroup network meta-analysis with dose of drugs as a moderator variable using dose ranges
based on previous consensus recommendations. We assessed certainty of evidence of NMA
treatment effects for all primary outcomes and drug class-specific side effects according to
GRADE (CINeMA, Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). We restricted GRADE assessment to
single drugs of direct interest compared to placebo.

Main results: We included 585 studies (97,516 randomized participants). Most of these studies
were small (median sample size of 100); they were published between 1965 and 2017 and were
primarily conducted in Asia (51%), Europe (25%), and North America (16%). Mean age of the
overall population was 42 years. Most participants were women (83%), had American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II (70%), received perioperative opioids (88%), and
underwent gynaecologic (32%) or gastrointestinal surgery (19%) under general anaesthesia

using volatile anaesthetics (88%). In this review, 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations were
compared. Most studies investigated only single drugs (72%) and included an inactive control
arm (66%). The three most investigated single drugs in this review were ondansetron (246
studies), dexamethasone (120 studies), and droperidol (97 studies). Almost all studies (89%)
reported at least one efficacy outcome relevant for this review. However, only 56% reported at
least one relevant safety outcome. Altogether, 157 studies (27%) were assessed as having
overall low risk of bias, 101 studies (17%) overall high risk of bias, and 327 studies (56%) overall
unclear risk of bias. Vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively Relative effects from NMA for
vomiting within 24 hours (282 RCTs, 50,812 participants, 28 single drugs, and 36 drug
combinations) suggest that 29 out of 36 drug combinations and 10 out of 28 single drugs
showed a clinically important benefit (defined as the upper end of the 95% confidence interval
(CI) below a risk ratio (RR) of 0.8) compared to placebo. Combinations of drugs were generally
more effective than single drugs in preventing vomiting. However, single NK₁ receptor
antagonists showed treatment effects similar to most of the drug combinations. High-certainty
evidence suggests that the following single drugs reduce vomiting (ordered by decreasing
efficacy): aprepitant (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38, high certainty, rank 3/28 of single drugs);
ramosetron (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59, high certainty, rank 5/28); granisetron (RR 0.45, 95%
CI 0.38 to 0.54, high certainty, rank 6/28); dexamethasone (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.57, high
certainty, rank 8/28); and ondansetron (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.60, high certainty, rank
13/28). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that the following single drugs probably reduce
vomiting: fosaprepitant (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, moderate certainty, rank 1/28) and
droperidol (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69, moderate certainty, rank 20/28). Recommended and
high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol showed clinically
important benefit, but low doses showed no clinically important benefit. Aprepitant was used
mainly at high doses, ramosetron at recommended doses, and fosaprepitant at doses of 150 mg
(with no dose recommendation available). Frequency of SAEs Twenty-eight RCTs were included
in the NMA for SAEs (10,766 participants, 13 single drugs, and eight drug combinations). The
certainty of evidence for SAEs when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs
(aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared
to placebo) ranged from very low to low. Droperidol (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.08 to 9.71, low certainty,
rank 6/13) may reduce SAEs. We are uncertain about the effects of aprepitant (RR 1.39, 95% CI
0.26 to 7.36, very low certainty, rank 11/13), ramosetron (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.74, very
low certainty, rank 7/13), granisetron (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 13.15, very low certainty, rank
10/13), dexamethasone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.85, very low certainty, rank 9/13), and
ondansetron (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.10, very low certainty, rank 12/13). No studies reporting
SAEs were available for fosaprepitant. Frequency of any AE Sixty-one RCTs were included in the
NMA for any AE (19,423 participants, 15 single drugs, and 11 drug combinations). The certainty
of evidence for any AE when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs

(aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared
to placebo) ranged from very low to moderate. Granisetron (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05,
moderate certainty, rank 7/15) probably has no or little effect on any AE. Dexamethasone (RR
0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.08, low certainty, rank 2/15) and droperidol (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98,
low certainty, rank 6/15) may reduce any AE. Ondansetron (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.01, low
certainty, rank 9/15) may have little or no effect on any AE. We are uncertain about the effects
of aprepitant (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, very low certainty, rank 3/15) and ramosetron (RR
1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54, very low certainty, rank 11/15) on any AE. No studies reporting any AE
were available for fosaprepitant. Class-specific side effects For class-specific side effects
(headache, constipation, wound infection, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, arrhythmia, and
QT prolongation) of relevant substances, the certainty of evidence for the best and most reliable
anti-vomiting drugs mostly ranged from very low to low. Exceptions were that ondansetron
probably increases headache (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28, moderate certainty, rank 18/23) and
probably reduces sedation (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96, moderate certainty, rank 5/24)
compared to placebo. The latter effect is limited to recommended and high doses of
ondansetron. Droperidol probably reduces headache (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, moderate
certainty, rank 5/23) compared to placebo. We have high-certainty evidence that
dexamethasone (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, high certainty, rank 16/24) has no effect on
sedation compared to placebo. No studies assessed substance class-specific side effects for
fosaprepitant. Direction and magnitude of network effect estimates together with level of
evidence certainty are graphically summarized for all pre-defined GRADE-relevant outcomes
and all drugs of direct interest compared to placebo in http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066353.

Authors' conclusions: We found high-certainty evidence that five single drugs (aprepitant,
ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron) reduce vomiting, and moderate-
certainty evidence that two other single drugs (fosaprepitant and droperidol) probably reduce
vomiting, compared to placebo. Four of the six substance classes (5-HT₃ receptor antagonists,
D₂ receptor antagonists, NK₁ receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids) were thus represented
by at least one drug with important benefit for prevention of vomiting. Combinations of drugs
were generally more effective than the corresponding single drugs in preventing vomiting. NK₁
receptor antagonists were the most effective drug class and had comparable efficacy to most of
the drug combinations. 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists were the best studied substance class. For
most of the single drugs of direct interest, we found only very low to low certainty evidence for
safety outcomes such as occurrence of SAEs, any AE, and substance class-specific side effects.
Recommended and high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol
were more effective than low doses for prevention of vomiting. Dose dependency of side effects
was rarely found due to the limited number of studies, except for the less sedating effect of
recommended and high doses of ondansetron. The results of the review are transferable mainly
to patients at higher risk of nausea and vomiting (i.e. healthy women undergoing inhalational
anaesthesia and receiving perioperative opioids). Overall study quality was limited, but certainty
assessments of effect estimates consider this limitation. No further efficacy studies are needed
as there is evidence of moderate to high certainty for seven single drugs with relevant benefit
for prevention of vomiting. However, additional studies are needed to investigate potential side
effects of these drugs and to examine higher-risk patient populations (e.g. individuals with
diabetes and heart disease).
