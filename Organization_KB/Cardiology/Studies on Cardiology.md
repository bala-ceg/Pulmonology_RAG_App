Abstract

This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands
upon the 2021 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the ESC member
countries. This paper examines inequalities in cardiovascular healthcare and outcomes in ESC
member countries utilizing mortality and risk factor data from the World Health Organization
and the Global Burden of Disease study with additional economic data from the World Bank.
Cardiovascular healthcare data were collected by questionnaire circulated to the national
cardiac societies of ESC member countries. Statistics pertaining to 2022, or latest available
year, are presented. New material in this report includes contemporary estimates of the
economic burden of CVD and mortality statistics for a range of CVD phenotypes. CVD accounts
for 11% of the EU's total healthcare expenditure. It remains the most common cause of death
in ESC member countries with over 3 million deaths per year. Proportionately more deaths
from CVD occur in middle-income compared with high-income countries in both females (53%
vs. 34%) and males (46% vs. 30%). Between 1990 and 2021, median age-standardized
mortality rates (ASMRs) for CVD decreased by median >50% in high-income ESC member
countries but in middle-income countries the median decrease was <12%. These inequalities
between middle- and high-income ESC member countries likely reflect heterogeneous
exposures to a range of environmental, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors. The 2023
survey suggests that treatment factors may also contribute with middle-income countries
reporting lower rates per million of percutaneous coronary intervention (1355 vs. 2330),
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (4.0 vs. 153.4) and pacemaker implantation (147.0 vs.
831.9) compared with high-income countries. The ESC Atlas 2023 report shows continuing
inequalities in the epidemiology and management of CVD between middle-income and high-
income ESC member countries. These inequalities are exemplified by the changes in CVD
ASMRs during the last 30 years. In the high-income ESC member countries, ASMRs have been

in steep decline during this period but in the middle-income countries declines have been
very small. There is now an important need for targeted action to reduce the burden of CVD,
particularly in those countries where the burden is greatest.

Abstract

Aims: This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and
expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics
for the 57 ESC member countries.

Methods and results: Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented.
Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure
and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic
and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, leftsided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and
progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable
diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018
are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income
(81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income
countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii)
The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC

member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality
standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the
ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries.
The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD
falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are
∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life
years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-
income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold
during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income
compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across
all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member
countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member
countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-
resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit
compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures,
device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures.

Conclusion: Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a
huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are
highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are
falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are
unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.

Abstract

The poorest billion people are distributed throughout the world, though most are concentrated
in rural sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) data can be sparse in

low- and middle-income countries beyond urban centers. Despite this urban bias, CVD registries
from the poorest countries have long revealed a predominance of nonatherosclerotic stroke,
hypertensive heart disease, nonischemic and Chagas cardiomyopathies, rheumatic heart
disease, and congenital heart anomalies, among others. Ischemic heart disease has been
relatively uncommon. Here, we summarize what is known about the epidemiology of CVDs
among the world's poorest people and evaluate the relevance of global targets for CVD control
in this population. We assessed both primary data sources, and the 2013 Global Burden of
Disease Study modeled estimates in the world's 16 poorest countries where 62% of the
population are among the poorest billion. We found that ischemic heart disease accounted for
only 12% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) in the poorest countries, compared with 51% of DALYs in high-income countries. We
found that as little as 53% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden
(1629/3049 DALYs per 100 000) was attributed to behavioral or metabolic risk factors in the
poorest countries (eg, in Niger, 82% of the population among the poorest billion) compared
with 85% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden (4439/5199 DALYs) in
high-income countries. Further, of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden,
34% was accrued in people under age 30 years in the poorest countries, while only 3% is
accrued under age 30 years in high-income countries. We conclude although the current global
targets for noncommunicable disease and CVD control will help diminish premature CVD death
in the poorest populations, they are not sufficient. Specifically, the current framework (1)
excludes deaths of people <30 years of age and deaths attributable to congenital heart
anomalies, and (2) emphasizes interventions to prevent and treat conditions attributed to
behavioral and metabolic risks factors. We recommend a complementary strategy for the
poorest populations that targets premature death at younger ages, addresses environmental
and infectious risks, and introduces broader integrated health system interventions, including
cardiac surgery for congenital and rheumatic heart disease.

Abstract

Background: The health of populations living in extreme poverty has been a long-standing focus
of global development efforts, and continues to be a priority during the Sustainable
Development Goal era. However, there has not been a systematic attempt to quantify the
magnitude and causes of the burden in this specific population for almost two decades. We
estimated disease rates by cause for the world's poorest billion and compared these rates to
those in high-income populations.

Methods: We defined the population in extreme poverty using a multidimensional poverty
index. We used national-level disease burden estimates from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease
Study and adjusted these to account for within-country variation in rates. To adjust for within-
country variation, we looked to the relationship between rates of extreme poverty and disease
rates across countries. In our main modeling approach, we used these relationships when there
was consistency with expert opinion from a survey we conducted of disease experts regarding
the associations between household poverty and the incidence and fatality of conditions.
Otherwise, no within-country variation was assumed. We compared results across multiple
approaches for estimating the burden in the poorest billion, including aggregating national-level
burden from the countries with the highest poverty rates. We examined the composition of the
estimated disease burden among the poorest billion and made comparisons with estimates for
high-income countries.

Results: The composition of disease burden among the poorest billion, as measured by
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was 65% communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
nutritional (CMNN) diseases, 29% non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and 6% injuries. Age-
standardized DALY rates from NCDs were 44% higher in the poorest billion (23,583 DALYs per
100,000) compared to high-income regions (16,344 DALYs per 100,000). Age-standardized DALY
rates were 2,147% higher for CMNN conditions (32,334 DALYs per 100,000) and 86% higher for
injuries (4,182 DALYs per 100,000) in the poorest billion, compared to high-income regions.

Conclusion: The disease burden among the poorest people globally compared to that in high
income countries is highly influenced by demographics as well as large disparities in burden
from many conditions. The comparisons show that the largest disparities remain in
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, though NCDs and injuries are an

important part of the "unfinished agenda" of poor health among those living in extreme
poverty.

Abstract

Background: Young people aged 10-24 years represent 27% of the world's population. Although
important health problems and risk factors for disease in later life emerge in these years, the
contribution to the global burden of disease is unknown. We describe the global burden of
disease arising in young people and the contribution of risk factors to that burden.

Methods: We used data from WHO's 2004 Global Burden of Disease study. Cause-specific
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for young people aged 10-24 years were estimated by WHO
region on the basis of available data for incidence, prevalence, severity, and mortality. WHO
member states were classified into low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, and
into WHO regions. We estimated DALYs attributable to specific global health risk factors using
the comparative risk assessment method. DALYs were divided into years of life lost because of
premature mortality (YLLs) and years lost because of disability (YLDs), and are presented for
regions by sex and by 5-year age groups.

Findings: The total number of incident DALYs in those aged 10-24 years was about 236 million,
representing 15·5% of total DALYs for all age groups. Africa had the highest rate of DALYs for this
age group, which was 2·5 times greater than in high-income countries (208 vs 82 DALYs per
1000 population). Across regions, DALY rates were 12% higher in girls than in boys between 15
and 19 years (137 vs 153). Worldwide, the three main causes of YLDs for 10-24-year-olds were
neuropsychiatric disorders (45%), unintentional injuries (12%), and infectious and parasitic
diseases (10%). The main risk factors for incident DALYs in 10-24-year-olds were alcohol (7% of

DALYs), unsafe sex (4%), iron deficiency (3%), lack of contraception (2%), and illicit drug use
(2%).

Interpretation: The health of young people has been largely neglected in global public health
because this age group is perceived as healthy. However, opportunities for prevention of disease
and injury in this age group are not fully exploited. The findings from this study suggest that
adolescent health would benefit from increased public health attention.

Abstract

Background: Despite the considerable epidemiological relevance of cancer in developing
countries, there are very few studies of the burden related to cancer. The aim of this study was
to present and discuss data from a burden-of-cancer study performed in a Southern Brazilian
state.

Methods: An epidemiological study of ecological design was performed to calculate the
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) index. The study was based on records of individuals
admitted and treated for cancer in the Brazilian National Health System Hospitals, or individuals
who had died of cancer while residing in the state of Santa Catarina in 2008.

Results: A total of 73,872.9 DALYs were estimated, which generated a rate of 1220.5
DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. The highest DALYs were those for cancer of the trachea, bronchus
and lung with 179.0/100,000 inhabitants, gastric cancer with 101.7/100,000 inhabitants, and
breast cancer with 99.7/100,000 inhabitants. The percentage contribution of the DALY
component varied according to cancer type; however, mortality was the major component in all
types. The highest rates were observed in 60-69-year-olds with 6071.3/100,000 inhabitants, in
70-79-year-olds with 5095.4/100,000 inhabitants, and in 45-59-year-olds with 3189.0
DALY/100,000 inhabitants; 53.7% of DALYs occurred in males.

Conclusions: The greatest burden of disease due to cancer in Santa Catarina was attributed to
cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung, followed by gastric and breast cancers. The mortality
component was responsible for the greatest burden.

Abstract

Aim: Cancer burden measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) captures survival and
disability impacts of incident cancers. In this paper, we estimate the prospective burden of
disease arising from 27 cancer sites diagnosed in 2006, by sex and ethnicity; and determine how
its distribution differs from that for incidence rates alone.

Methods: Using a prospective approach, Markov and cancer disease models were used to
estimate DALYs with inputs of population counts, incidence and excess mortality rates, disability
weights, and background mortality. DALYs were discounted at 3.5% per year.

Results: The age standardised Māori:non-Māori incidence rate ratios were 1.00 for males and
1.19 for females, whereas for DALYs they were greater at 1.42 for males and 1.68 for females.
The total burden of cancer for 2006 incident cases (i.e. not age standardised) was estimated to
be approximately 127,000 DALYs. Breast (27%), lung (14%) and colorectal (13%) cancers for
females and lung (16%), colorectal (14%), and prostate (16%) cancers for males were the top
contributors. By ethnicity, Māori experienced a substantially higher burden from lung cancer
(around 25% for both sexes).

Conclusions: Due to Māori both having higher rates of cancers with a worse survival (e.g. lung
cancer), and tending to have worse survival for each cancer site, ethnic disparities in the age-
standardised DALY burden were greater than those for incidence (rate ratios of 1.52 and 1.07
respectively, sexes pooled).

Abstract

Background: This study aims to estimate the burden of cancer in England and Wales using
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and to determine if the ranking of relative importance
changes with metric used.

Methods: DALYs are the sum of years of life lost due to mortality and years lost due to disability.
Annual DALYs due to cancer were calculated using cancer registration, mortality, disability
weights and World Health Organization methodology.

Results: There were 8 605 362 DALYs due to cancer (3242 DALYs/100 000 population/year). Of
the total, 47% corresponded to lung, prostate and colorectal cancers in males and 56% to
breast, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers in females. Mortality (86% of DALYs) contributed
predominantly to DALYs. Individuals of 65-75 years contributed to 28% of DALYs. Among
females, lung cancer ranked highest by death rates, whereas the highest DALYs were from
breast cancer.

Conclusions: Highest DALYs were due to lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers in England
and Wales. The addition of the disability component changes the relative position of some of
the top cancers. Although metrics based on deaths alone capture most effects of cancer on
population health levels, important additional perspectives, relevant to the planning of services,
can be gained from burden of disease analyses.

Abstract

Introduction: The Singapore Burden of Disease (SBoD) Study 2004 provides a comprehensive
and detailed assessment of the size and distribution of health problems in Singapore. It is the
first local study to use disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to quantify the total disease burden.

Methods: The SBoD study applied the methods developed for the original Global Burden of
Disease study to data specific to Singapore to compute the DALYs. DALY is a summary measure
of population health that combines time lost due to premature mortality (years of life lost [YLL])
with time spent in ill-health (broadly-termed disability) arising from incident cases of disease or
injury (years of life lost due to disability [YLD]). DALYs, stratified by gender and age group, were
calculated for more than 130 specific health conditions for the Singapore resident population
for the year 2004.

Results: In 2004, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top three
leading causes of premature death and ill-health in Singapore, and together accounted for more
than one-quarter (28 percent) of the total disease burden (in DALYs). Morbidity burden (YLD)
was responsible for 52 percent of the total DALYs, with diabetes mellitus, anxiety and
depression, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias being the main sources of the total
YLDs. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke and lung cancer were the major contributors to the
premature mortality burden (YLL).

Conclusion: This study provides an objective and systematic assessment of the fatal and
nonfatal health conditions in Singapore to support priority setting in public health policies and
research.

Abstract

Introduction: With the implementation of low-dose computed tomography screening, multiple
pulmonary tumor nodules are diagnosed with increasing frequency and the selection of surgical
treatments versus systemic therapies has become challenging on a daily basis in clinical
practice. In the presence of multiple carcinomas, especially adenocarcinomas, pathologically
determined to be of pulmonary origin, the distinction between separate primary lung
carcinomas (SPLCs) and intrapulmonary metastases (IPMs) is important for staging,
management, and prognostication.

Methods: We systemically reviewed various means that aid in the differentiation between SPLCs
and IPMs explored by histopathologic evaluation and molecular profiling, the latter includes
DNA microsatellite analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization, TP53 and oncogenic
driver mutation testing and, more recently, with promising effectiveness, next-generation
sequencing comprising small- or large-scale multi-gene panels.

Results: Comprehensive histologic evaluation may suffice to differentiate between SPLCs and
IPMs. Nevertheless, molecular profiling using larger-scale next-generation sequencing typically
provides superior discriminatory power, allowing for more accurate classification. On the basis
of the literature review and expert opinions, we proposed a combined four-step histologic and
molecular classification algorithm for addressing multiple pulmonary tumor nodules of
adenocarcinoma histology that encourages a multidisciplinary approach. It is also noteworthy
that new technologies combining machine learning and digital pathology may develop into
valuable diagnostic tools for distinguishing SPLCs from IPMs in the future.

Conclusions: Although histopathologic evaluation is often adequate to differentiate SPLCs from
IPMs, molecular profiling should be performed when possible, especially in cases with tumors
exhibiting similar morphology. This manuscript summarized the previous efforts in resolving the
current challenges and highlighted the recent progress in the differentiation methods and
algorithms used in categorizing multiple lung adenocarcinomas into SPLCs or IPMs, which are
becoming more and more critical in precision lung cancer management.

Abstract

Purpose: In patients with >1 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the distinction between
separate primary lung carcinomas (SPLCs) and intrapulmonary metastases (IPMs) is a common
diagnostic dilemma with critical staging implications. Here, we compared the performance of
comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) with standard histopathologic approaches for
distinguishing NSCLC clonal relationships in clinical practice.

Experimental design: We queried 4,119 NSCLCs analyzed by 341-468 gene MSK-IMPACT NGS
assay for patients with >1 surgically resected tumor profiled by NGS. Tumor relatedness
predicted by prospective histopathologic assessment was contrasted with comparative genomic
profiling by subsequent NGS.

Results: Sixty patients with NGS performed on >1 NSCLCs were identified, yielding 76 tumor
pairs. NGS classified tumor pairs into 51 definite SPLCs (median, 14; up to 72 unique somatic
mutations per pair), and 25 IPMs (24 definite, one high probability; median, 5; up to 16 shared
somatic mutations per pair). Prospective histologic prediction was discordant with NGS in 17
cases (22%), particularly in the prediction of IPMs (44% discordant). Retrospective review
highlighted several histologic challenges, including morphologic progression in some IPMs. We
subsampled MSK-IMPACT data to model the performance of less comprehensive assays, and
identified several clinicopathologic differences between NGS-defined tumor pairs, including
increased risk of subsequent recurrence for IPMs.

Conclusions: Comprehensive NGS allows unambiguous delineation of clonal relationship among
NSCLCs. In comparison, standard histopathologic approach is adequate in most cases, but has
notable limitations in the recognition of IPMs. Our results support the adoption of broad panel

NGS to supplement histology for robust discrimination of NSCLC clonal relationships in clinical
practice.

Abstract

The distinction between different separate primary lung cancers (SPLCs) and intrapulmonary
metastases (IPMs) is a challenging but clinically significant issue. Histopathology-based
classification is the current practice; however, it is subjective and affected by interobserver
variability. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have been used in lung cancer
diagnostics. This study aimed to investigate the value of large-scale NGS panels for
distinguishing between SPLCs and IPMs. A total of 32 patients with 69 lung adenocarcinomas
were included. Comprehensive histopathologic assessments of multiple pulmonary
adenocarcinomas were performed independently by 3 pathologists. The consensus of
histopathologic classification was determined by a majority vote. Genomic analysis was
performed using an amplicon-based large-scale NGS panel, targeting single-nucleotide variants
and short insertions and deletions in 409 genes. Tumor pairs were classified as SPLCs or IPMs
according to a predefined molecular classification algorithm. Using NGS and our molecular
classification algorithm, 97.6% of the tumor pairs can be unambiguously classified as SPLCs or
IPMs. The molecular classification was predictive of postoperative clinical outcomes in terms of
overall survival (P = .015) and recurrence-free interval (P = .0012). There was a moderate
interobserver agreement regarding histopathologic classification (κ = 0.524 at the tumor pair

where pathologists reached a complete agreement but only 53.3% where they did not. This
study showed that large-scale NGS panels are a powerful modality that can help distinguish
SPLCs from IPMs in patients with multiple lung adenocarcinomas and objectively provide
accurate risk stratification.

Abstract

The classification of multifocal lung adenocarcinomas (MLAs), including multiple primary lung
adenocarcinomas (MPLAs) and intrapulmonary metastases (IPMs), has great clinical significance
in staging and treatment determination. However, the application of molecular approaches in
pN0M0 MLA diagnosis has not been well investigated. Here, we performed next-generation
sequencing (NGS) analysis in 45 pN0M0 MLA patients (101 lesion pairs) who were initially
diagnosed as having MPLA by comprehensive histologic assessment (CHA). Five additional
patients with intrathoracic metastases were used as positive controls, while 197 patients with
unifocal lung adenocarcinomas (425 random lesion pairs) were used as negative controls. By
utilizing a predefined NGS criterion, all IPMs in the positive control group could be accurately
classified, whereas 13 lesion pairs (3.1%) in the negative control cohort were misdiagnosed as
IPMs. Additionally, 14 IPM lesion pairs were diagnosed in the study group, with at least 7
misdiagnoses. We thus developed a refined algorithm, incorporating both NGS and histologic
results, that could correctly diagnose all the known MPLAs and IPMs. In particular, all IPMs
identified by the refined algorithm were diagnosed to be IPMs or suspected IPMs by CHA
reassessment. The refined algorithm-diagnosed MPLAs patients also had significantly better
progression-free survival than the refined algorithm-diagnosed IPMs (p < 0.0001), which is
superior to conventional NGS or CHA diagnoses. Overall, we developed an NGS-based algorithm
that could accurately distinguish IPMs from MPLAs in MLA patients. Our results demonstrate a
promising clinical utility of NGS to complement traditional CHA-based MLA diagnosis and help
determine patient staging and treatment.

Abstract

Distinguishing between multiple primary lung cancers and intrapulmonary metastases is crucial
for staging, therapeutic planning, and prognosis. Traditional histological assessment provides a
foundation for diagnosis, which can be limited when tumors showed identical or similar
histological types. This systematic review and independent validation study aimed to evaluate
the performance of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular algorithms alongside
histological methods for the classification of multiple lung adenocarcinomas (MLAs). We
conducted a literature search to identify relevant studies and selected algorithms for validation
using a cohort of patients with MLAs. Our analysis included 27 patients with MLAs and
compared histological assessment using Martini and Melamed criteria and comprehensive
histologic assessment combined with a low-grade lepidic component (CHA & lepidic) with NGS
data. We found a high consistency between CHA & lepidic and NGS-based diagnoses, although
some discrepancies remained, particularly in cases with no somatic mutations or distant
metastases. NGS-based molecular algorithms offer a high degree of accuracy in determining the
origin of MLAs, supporting or challenging histological diagnoses. However, histological methods
remain valuable, especially when NGS data are inconclusive. This study underscores the
complementary nature of histology and molecular diagnostics in the precise classification of
MLAs.

Abstract

Purpose: The distinction between multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs) and intrapulmonary
metastases has a significant impact on tumor staging and therapeutic choices. Several criteria
have been proposed to solve this diagnostic issue, but a definitive consensus is still missing. We
tested the efficacy of a combined clinical, histopathological and molecular ("real world")
approach for the correct classification of multiple lung tumors in a selected cohort of patients.

Methods: 24 multiple lung tumors with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma from 10 patients were
retrospectively reviewed. Radiological, pathological and clinical information, including follow-
up, were integrated with molecular profiling via a routine multigene panel sequencing.

Results: Comprehensive histologic assessment revealed readily distinguishable histologic
patterns between multiple tumors suggesting unrelated lesions in 7 cases, in agreement with
clinical, radiological and molecular data, thus leading to final diagnosis of MPLCs. In the
remaining 3 cases, the differential diagnosis between MPLCs and intrapulmonary metastases
was challenging, since the histologic features of the lesions were similar or identical. The final
interpretation (2 MPLCs and 1 most likely intrapulmonary metastases) was reached thanks to
the integration of all available data, and was confirmed by follow-up.

Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach including a routinely affordable multigene panel
sequencing is a useful tool to discriminate MPLCs from intrapulmonary metastases in multiple
lung nodules sharing the adenocarcinoma histotype.

Abstract

The aim of this study was to explore morphologic and molecular features distinguishing
between multifocal lung adenocarcinoma (MLA) and intrapulmonary metastases (IMs). Sixteen
patients with MLAs, a total of 34 tumors, were reviewed. Four approaches were used: (1) array-
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) as a standard clonality assessment; (2) EGFR and
KRAS mutational profiles as a supplementary method; (3) comprehensive histologic assessment
(CHA) was method I in pathology evaluation; and (4) CHA combined with lepidic component
analysis was method II. The lepidic component was divided into low grade and high grade
according to extent of atypia; tumors with low-grade lepidic component were defined as
primary. Eight patients were found to have IMs and 8 to have multiple primaries (MPs) by array-
CGH; 7 had MPs and 9 had IMs by method I; 5 had MPs and 11 had IMs by method II. Compared
with array-CGH, method I had a lower coincidence rate (65%) than method II (85%). Univariate
analysis revealed that patients with MP had a better clinical outcome than those with IM only if
the MPs were diagnosed by array-CGH (P = .034) or method II (P = .027) but not EGFR/KRAS
mutation (P = .843) or method I (P = .493). Our results suggest that a low-grade lepidic
component is a sign of a primary tumor. CHA combined with a low-grade lepidic component
(method II) is more accurate clinically and more cost-effective in distinguishing MLAs from IMs.
Also, EGFR mutation is not an appropriate molecular marker for clonality assessment.

Abstract

Accurately distinguishing between multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC) and intrapulmonary
metastasis (IPM) is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.
While molecular methods offer significant advantages over traditional clinical-pathological
evaluations, they lack standardized diagnostic protocols and validated prognostic value. This
study systematically compared the diagnostic and prognostic performance of molecular
methods versus clinical-pathological evaluations in diagnosing multiple lung cancers (MLCs),
specifically focusing on the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) parameters on
diagnostic accuracy. A review of 41 studies encompassing 1266 patients revealed that two
molecular methods, Mole1 (manually counting shared mutations) and Mole2 (bioinformatics-
assisted clonal probability calculation), both demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy and
prognostic discrimination capabilities. Molecular assessment, particularly Mole1, effectively
stratified prognosis for MPLC and IPM, leading to significantly improved disease-free survival
(DFS: HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15-0.39) and overall survival (OS: HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58).
Further analysis suggests that a minimal panel of 30-50 genes may be sufficient to effectively
differentiate prognoses. Compared to Mole1, Mole2 demonstrated greater specificity and
stability across various panels, achieving AUC values from 0.962 to 0.979. Clinical-pathological
evaluations proved unreliable, not only failing to distinguish prognosis effectively but also
exhibiting a potential misdiagnosis rate of 35.5% and 33.6% compared to the reference
diagnosis. To improve both cost-effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy, bioinformatics-assisted
molecular diagnostics should be integrated into multidisciplinary assessments, especially for
high-risk cases where diagnostic errors are common.

Abstract

Nowadays, lung cancer is a leading cause of death in both men and women worldwide. There is
no clear explanation for its mortality rate. However, it is already known that genetic and
environmental factors as well as oncological treatment are involved. As the incidence of lung
cancer soars, the number of patients diagnosed with multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC) is
also rising. While differentiating between MPLC and intrapulmonary metastasis of lung cancer is
important for treatment strategy and prognosis, it is also quite complicated, particularly in the
cases with similar histologies. It is also important not to delay the diagnosis. The aim of this
paper was to discuss MPLC in general, and the differentiation between MPLC and
intrapulmonary lung cancer metastasis in particular. Based on a review of statistical data and
the current literature, we discuss the diagnostic criteria and the molecular, genetic and
radiographic methods used to distinguish between MPLC and intrapulmonary metastases.

Multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) refers to lung cancer in which two or more primary lesions
occurred simultaneously or successively in different parts of the same patient's lungs. The
diagnosis interval is 6 months. MPLC is divided into synchronous MPLC (sMPLC) and
metachronous MPLC (mMPLC). sMPLC and intrapulmonary metastasis (IM) are different in
treatment strategies and prognosis. However, there are many controversies about the
distinction between the two in clinical practice. This article summarizes the current main

methods of diagnosing MPLC, and focuses on the latest research progress in distinguishing
MPLC from IM. It aims to provide a theoretical basis for accurate diagnosis and treatment of
patients with multifocal lung cancer. .

Abstract

in English, Chinese

Multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) refers to patients with two or more primary lesions of lung
cancer. It can be divided into synchronous MPLC (sMPLC) and metachronous MPLC (mMPLC)
based on the timing of occurrence. In recent years, the detection rate of MPLC has gradually
increased. However, considerable controversy exists in distinguishing MPLC from
intrapulmonary metastasis (IM), especially when the histopathological types are identical. Given
the significant differences in treatment strategies and prognosis in clinical practice currently,
accurate diagnosis of MPLC is crucial for personalized precision therapy. Molecular genetics and
sequencing technologies offer effective strategies for assessing the clonal origin of tumors.
There have been reports of coexisting mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion genes in non-small cell lung cancer, but case of
EGFR mutation following an ALK mutation has not been mentioned. This article accurately
diagnoses and retrospectively analyzes the clinical data of a case of ALK mutant
adenocarcinoma in a male patient who developed an EGFR mutation with multiple metastases
four years after surgery, and reviews the relevant literature. This paper aims to deepen the

understanding of mMPLC and provide clinical references for the diagnosis and treatment of
such patients. .

Abstract

Introduction: The 8th edition lung cancer staging system was the first to describe the detailed
diagnosis and staging of multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC). However, the characteristics and
prognosis of MPLC categorized according to the new system have not been evaluated.

Method: We retrospectively analyzed data from surgically treated MPLC patients in a single
center from 2011 to 2013 and explored the characteristics and outcomes of different MPLC
disease patterns.

Results: In total, 202 surgically treated MPLC patients were identified and classified into
different groups according to disease categories and diagnostic time (multifocal ground
glass/lepidic (GG/L) nodules: n = 139, second primary lung cancer (SPLC): n = 63, simultaneous
MPLC (sMPLC): n = 171, and metachronous MPLC (mMPLC): n = 31). There were significant
differences in clinical characteristics between SPLC and GG/L nodule patients and simultaneous
and metachronous MPLC patients. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year lung cancer-specific survival
rates of MPLC were 97.98%, 90.18%, and 82.81%, respectively. Five-year survival was better in
patients with multiple GG/L nodules than in those with SPLC (87.94% vs. 71.29%, P < 0.05). Sex
was an independent prognostic factor for sMPLC (5-year survival, female vs. male, 88.0% vs.
69.5%, P < 0.05), and in multiple tumors, the highest tumor stage was an independent
prognostic factor for all categories of MPLC.

Conclusions: The different disease patterns of MPLC have significantly different characteristics
and prognoses. Clinicians should place treatment emphasis on the tumor with the highest stage
as it is the main contributor to the prognosis of all categories of MPLC patients.

Abstract

in English, Chinese

With the application of high-resolution chest imaging system and lung cancer screening
program, patients with multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) are becoming a growing population
in clinical practice. However, the diagnostic criteria of MPLC and its differentiation from
intrapulmonary metastasis of lung cancer (IM) are still controversial, especially in cases with
similar histology. On the basis of reviewing the existing literature, this paper discusses the
changes of the diagnostic criteria of MPLC and the differential diagnosis methods of imaging,
histology and molecular genetics of MPLC and IM, and briefly introduces the application of
multidisciplinary diagnosis, algorithm, predictive model and artificial intelligence in the
differential diagnosis of MPLC. In addition, we also discuss the latest progress in the treatment
of MPLC. Radical surgery is the main method for the treatment of MPLC. Stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) is safe and feasible for inoperable MPLC patients, and targeted therapy
and immunotherapy can also be used in MPLC after appropriate patient selection.

Abstract

Background: In lung cancer management, differential diagnosis between multiple primary lung
cancer (MPLC) and intrapulmonary metastasis (IMP) is a critical point that is of direct
therapeutic and clinical importance. However, this process often suffers from absence of a gold
standard, resulting in equivocal cases. Herein, we present a series of three cases, in which
genomic alteration patterns revealed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) facilitated the
differential diagnosis between MPLC and IMP.

Case presentation: Case 1 was a 57-year-old female with two separate lesions in the upper lobe
and the lower lobe of left lung, which were both histopathologically determined as T2aN0M0
adenocarcinomas. NGS identified an EGFR L858R in one lesion and an EGFR 20 exon insertion in
the other one, suggestive of double primary malignancies. The patient underwent wedge
resections and received an adjuvant treatment of icotinib and chemotherapy. She had a disease-
free survival (DFS) of 19 months and counting. Case 2 was a 55-year-old female with multiple
small lesions in both lungs. Histopathological examinations of resected lesions from right upper
lobe revealed three subtypes: atypical adenomatous hyperplasia of alveolar epithelium,
adenocarcinomas in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. NGS identified two different
BRAF driver mutations G466E and V600_K601delinsE in two lesions of adenocarcinoma in situ,
and a BRAF K601E in a lesion of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. Case 3, a 68-year-old male,
had the right upper lobe lesion histophathologically classified as a stage T3NxM0 mixed
adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma and the left upper lobe lesion as a stage T1aN0M0
adenocarcinoma. NGS performed with different loci of surgical tissues revealed a rare
sensitizing EGFR mutation G719A shared by the right upper lobe lesion and lymph node, and
two EGFR mutations L861Q and G719S in left upper lobe lesion. The patient received icotinib
treatment postoperatively and achieved a stable disease with a progression-free survival of 5
months.

Conclusion: Our cases provide evidence for utility of NGS in facilitating diagnosis and treatment
decisions.

Abstract

Discovery of driver mutations in pulmonary adenocarcinoma has revolutionized the field of
thoracic oncology with major impact on therapy and diagnosis. Testing for EGFR, ALK, and KRAS
mutations has become part of everyday practice. We report a case with multiple synchronous
primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas in a 72-year-old female with previous history of smoking.
The patient presented with cough and bilateral lung ground glass opacities. A positron emission
tomography/computed tomography scan showed no activity in mediastinal lymph nodes. She
underwent a left upper lobe biopsy and a right upper lobe wedge resection. Pathology revealed
4 morphologically distinct adenocarcinoma foci, suggestive of synchronous primary lung
tumors. Molecular testing demonstrated no mutation in the left tumor. Three different driver
mutations were present in the right lung tumors: KRAS codon 12 G12D and G12V and EGFR
exon 21 L858R mutation, confirming the initial histologic impression. Subsequently, left upper
lobe lobectomy showed 3 additional foci of adenocarcinoma with different morphologies,
suggestive of synchronous primaries as well. No additional molecular testing was performed.
Synchronous pulmonary adenocarcinomas are not uncommon; however, 4 or more
synchronous tumors are rare. Distinguishing multiple primary tumors from intrapulmonary
metastases is a common problem in thoracic oncology with major implications for staging,
prognosis, and treatment. Lung adenocarcinoma subclassification based on predominant and
coexisting histologic patterns can greatly facilitate differentiation between intrapulmonary
metastases and multiple synchronous tumors. Use of molecular profiling is recommended since
it further increases confidence in the diagnostic workup of multiple pulmonary
adenocarcinomas and helps guiding therapy.

Abstract

Background: Synchronous multiple primary lung cancers (sMPLC) are rare forms of lung cancer,
and their diagnosis remains as a significant challenge. Distinguishing sMPLC from advanced
disease is important as their prognoses and therapeutic management vary dramatically.

Case presentation: The patient was a 56-year-old Chinese male who exhibited six synchronous
invasive adenocarcinomas at diagnosis [T2(6)N0M0], and who achieved durable clinical benefit
under adjuvant chemotherapy for 41 months following wedge resection and lobectomy. Whole-
exome sequencing revealed that two lesions (L4 and L6) in the left upper lobe of the patient's
lung shared 28 nonsynonymous mutations; thus, suggesting that the lesions may have arisen
from a common ancestor at the early stages of tumorigenesis, and spread into distinct histologic
subtypes. Moreover, while L5 was in the same lobe as L4 and L6, it represented a distinct
lineage as it did not share any mutations with other lesions. Notably, the BRAF V600E oncogenic
mutation was exclusive to L5. In addition, the KRAS G12C mutation was identified in three
lesions (L1-L3) located in the right lung, which may have resulted from convergent evolution.

Conclusion: We report a patient with six synchronous invasive adenocarcinomas who
demonstrated durable clinical benefits under adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical
treatment. While cancer staging is one of the many challenges associated with sMPLC, the data
generated through next-generation sequencing can provide information on lesion origins, and
thus, advance the era of precision medicine.

Abstract

The diagnosis of multiple primary lung cancer is sometimes difficult when multiple lung tumors
with the same histologic type are identified. We now present a case of synchronous double
primary lung adenocarcinomas (one in the right upper lobe and another in the right middle
lobe) diagnosed based on mutational analysis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
gene, although clinico-pathological findings suggested the diagnosis of intrapulmonary
metastasis. After complete resection, pathological sections revealed the similar pathological
features of two adenocarcinomas and unexpected subcarinal nodal metastasis. As the L858R
mutation within exon 21 of the EGFR gene was identified in the middle-lobe tumor and the
subcarinal node but not in the upper-lobe tumor, we diagnosed as double primary cancers.
Local mediastinal recurrence after operation has been well-controlled with administration of
gefitinib, a EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and mutational analysis of the EGFR gene provided
important information not only in the diagnosis of double primary cancers but also in decision-
making of selection of chemotherapeutic agent.

Abstract

Purpose: Adenocarcinoma remains the most common subtype of lung cancer in the United
States. Most patients present with tumors that are invasive and often metastatic, but in some
patients, multiple precursor in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma tumors develop that
can be synchronous and metachronous. These precursor lesions harbor the same spectrum of
genetic mutations found in purely invasive adenocarcinomas, such as EGFR, KRAS, and p53
mutations. It is less clear, however, whether separate lesions in patients who present with
multifocal disease share common underlying genetic driver mutations.

Methods: Here we review the relevant literature on molecular driver alterations in
adenocarcinoma precursor lesions. We then report 4 patients with multifocal EGFR mutant
adenocarcinomas in whom we performed molecular testing on 2 separate lesions.

Findings: In 2 of these patients, the mutations are concordant, and in 2 patients, the mutations
are discordant. A review of the literature demonstrates increasing evidence that lesions with
discordant mutations may confer a more favorable prognosis because they are unlikely to
represent metastases.

Implications: Our findings suggest that the emergence of the dominant EGFR driver alteration is
often independent between lesions in patients with multifocal adenocarcinomas, and thus the
same targeted therapy may not be effective for all lesions. However, genetic testing of multiple
lesions can help to distinguish separate primary tumors from metastatic disease.

Abstract

Background: The coexistence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in patients with multifocal lung

adenocarcinomas (LUAC) constitutes a rare molecular subtype of lung cancer. We aimed to
investigate the intertumoral heterogeneity of pathologic and genetic characteristics of
multifocal LUAC with EGFR/ALK co-alterations.

Patients and methods: A total of 1059 LUAC patients who underwent resection were
investigated to screen for EGFR or ALK alterations using amplification refractory mutation
system polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Molecular testing was extensively performed in patients with synchronous
multifocal LUAC. Clonal evolution analysis was implemented using next-generation sequencing.

Results: A total of 97 multiple synchronous lesions were observed among 1059 LUAC patients.
Patients with at least 1 sample harboring EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement were 62.89%
(61/97) and 14.43% (14/97), respectively. Patients with concomitant EGFR and ALK alterations
were 4.71% (4/97). Comparatively, patients with unifocal LUAC harboring EGFR mutation, ALK
rearrangement, and EGFR/ALK co-alterations were 58.25% (570/962), 6.44% (62/962), and
0.83% (8/962), respectively. The prevalence of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in the multifocal LUAC
was significantly higher than that in the unifocal LUAC (4.71% (4/97) vs. 0.83% (8/962)).
Furthermore, we present 4 cases of EGFR/ALK co-altered multifocal LUAC with different
morphological and molecular patterns. In addition to radiographic, pathological, and molecular
testing results, clonal evolutional analysis could also be used to distinguish intertumoral
heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of distinguishing synchronous primary tumors
from intrapulmonary metastases, and of assessing the relative abundance of EGFR mutation

Abstract

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
rearrangements are considered mutually exclusive in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
especially in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC). However, sporadic cases harboring
concomitant EGFR and ALK alterations have been increasingly reported. There is no consensus
opinion regarding the treatment of patients positive for both molecular alterations. NSCLC
with EGFR/ALK coalterations should be separated into two subtypes: unifocal and multifocal
LUAC. Here, we present an overview of the available literature regarding this rare group of
patients to provide useful suggestions for therapeutic strategies.

Keywords: EGFR/ALK coaltered; Lung adenocarcinoma; two different patterns.

Abstract

Background: In non-small cell lung cancer common driver mutations such as epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are usually mutually exclusive.
This study aimed to elucidate the concurrence of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement in
eastern India patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma and assess the response of EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after 6 months in primary lung adenocarcinoma.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 198 adenocarcinomas for EGFR and ALK mutations. EGFR
and ALK tests were done by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) techniques, respectively. Radiological response was assessed by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1).

Results: EGFR/ALK co-alteration was found in 4 adenocarcinoma patients. All were males with
advanced disease. Younger patients had exon 19 deletion whereas older ones showed exon 21
mutation. The initial option of ALK-TKI in all four patients was excluded straightaway due to the

high-cost burden of ALK-TKI. Two of them showed a partial response while other two had stable
disease after 6 months of EGFR TKI therapy.

Conclusion: EGFR/ALK co-alterations in adenocarcinomas albeit rare do exist. The challenge of
monetary hurdle in developing countries with ALK TKI therapy can be handled by giving only
EGFR TKI in these cases of concomitant mutations. Future perspective in research could be
finding an agent with the potential of dual inhibition of ALK and EGFR.

Abstract

Background: The prevalence of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in patients with NSCLC was low. The
several previous studies focused on the simultaneous occurrence of EGFR mutations and ALK
rearrangements in a unifocal lung cancer. However, the incidence of multifocal pulmonary
adenocarcinomas was increasingly encountered in clinical practice, due to the increased
availability and improvement of the thoracic imaging. The clinical relevance of EGFR/ALK co-
alterations in multifocal adenocarcinomas required detailed investigation as well.

Case presentation: We present the case of a 57-year-old woman with solid nodule in the left
upper lung and a ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe, who underwent radical operation.
Pathological examination confirmed multifocal adenocarcinoma, molecular tests revealed that
the left upper lung lesion was positive for ALK rearrangement but the left lower lobe displayed
EGFR mutation positive separately. The patient pulmonary lesions were well controlled by
adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When brain metastases occurred, EGFR-TKI was
not effective after firstly administration, while subsequent ALK inhibitors were efficient. We

retrospective evaluated the oncogenic status of metastatic lymph nodes and found that the
driver gene was ALK rearrangement rather than EGFR mutation.

Conclusions: The status of the oncogenic mutations in lymph node metastasis may provide
some effective hints for metastasis lesion in other organ or tissue. Therefore, it is recommended
to fully evaluate the driver genes in lymph node metastasis after radical resection.

Abstract

Pharmacologic agents that target protein products of oncogenes in tumors are playing an
increasing clinical role in the treatment of cancer. Currently, the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for patients with
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR
mutations. Subsequently other genetic abnormalities with "driver" characteristics - implying
transforming and tumor maintenance capabilities have been extensively reported in several
small distinct subsets of NSCLC. Among these rare genetic changes, anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) gene rearrangements, most often consisting in a chromosome 2 inversion leading to a
fusion with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) gene, results in the
abnormal expression and activation of this tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. This
rearrangement occurs in 2-5% of NSCLC, predominantly in young (50 years or younger), never-
or former-smokers with adenocarcinoma. This aberration most commonly occurs a
independently of EGFR and KRAS gene mutations. A fluorescent in situ hybridization assay was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the standard method for the
detection of ALK gene rearrangement in clinical practice and is considered the gold standard.
Crizotinib, a first-in-class dual ALK and c-MET inhibitor, has been shown to be particularly
effective against ALK positive NSCLC, showing dramatic and prolonged responses with low
toxicity, predominantly restricted to the gastro-intestinal and visual systems, and generally self-
limiting or easily managed. However, resistance to crizotinib inevitably emerges. The molecular

mechanisms of resistance are currently under investigation, as are therapeutic approaches
including crizotinib-based combination therapy and novel agents such as Hsp90 inhibitors. This
review aims to present the current knowledge on this fusion gene, the clinic-pathological profile
of ALK rearranged NSCLC, and to review the existing literature on ALK inhibitors, focusing on
their role in the treatment of NSCLC.

Abstract

Empirical evidence has long suggested that oncogenic driver mutations in non-small-cell lung
cancer are mutually independent. However, recent studies reported in pertinent literature
reveal that concomitant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement can occur in a subset of patients with NSCLC. In order to
shed further light on this issue, we report a case of adenocarcinoma of lung harboring both
EGFR mutation in exon 21 (L861Q) and ALK rearrangement. This allows us to speculate on likely
molecular mechanisms underlying this uncommon phenomenon, while also offering some
practical guidelines on the therapeutic options that could benefit patients diagnosed with this
dual-positive tumor.

Abstract

in English, Chinese

Molecular target therapy is one of the most popular field of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
treatmnet. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) rearragement are the most important two oncogenic drivers in NSCLC, early studies
suggested that EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive, but isolated
cases or small sample research with concomitant EGFR and ALK alterations have been
constantly reported. The co-occurrence of EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) rearrangements constitutes a rare molecular, the frequency of EGFR/ALK co-alterations
was about 1%, however, little has been known about clinicopathologic feature and treatment.
This review summarized published case report, EGFR and ALK alterations are common in
female, Asian origin, never smoker, IV stage, and denocarcinomas. First-line treatment can
choose EGFR or ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, studies about the origin and
resistance mechanism in EGFR/ALK co-alterations are little, require more experimental and
clinical research. .
