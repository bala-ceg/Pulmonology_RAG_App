## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- OpenAI API Key
- ChromaDB
- Whisper AI

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pulmonology-rag-app.git
   cd pulmonology-rag-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   export BASE_URL='your_openai_base_url'
   export LLM_MODEL_NAME='your_model_name'
   export EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME='your_embedding_model'
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python Pulmonology_RAG_App/main.py
   ```
5. Access the web interface at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Usage
- Type a query or use voice input to interact with the chatbot.
- Retrieve AI-generated responses with citations from medical documents.
- Edit and refine messages before sending.
- Save chat history for future reference.

## Metadata Files
This repository includes sample metadata files `pdf_metadata.json` and
`url_metadata.json`. These files contain small example entries with relative
paths pointing to the `sample_data` folder. When running the application with
your own documents, replace these files with metadata generated by
`extract_pdf.py` and `extract_html.py`. Place the resulting JSON files in the
project root so `main.py` can load them during startup.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating more document types (e.g., medical journals, databases).
- Improving UI with advanced chat features.
- Deploying as a cloud-based service.
