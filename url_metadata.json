This study aimed to evaluate the relation between clinical practice and the outcomes of patients admitted for COPD exacerbations in Portuguese hospitals.\nMaterials and Methods\nObservational, multicentre, prospective study with a 60-days follow-up period, in 11 hospitals, including patients aged \u2265 30 years, admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, smoking habits, hospitalisations, pulmonary function, comorbidities, COPD symptoms, and treatment. Sixty days after discharge, COPD exacerbations management, outcome measures, and readmission data were evaluated through a structured phone follow-up interview.\nResults\n196 patients were included (85.7% male, mean age 71.2 years), the majority admitted through the emergency service. Ex-smokers and current smokers accounted for 51% and 36%, respectively. On admission, 72.4% were on LAMA, 54.6% on LABA, and 45.5% were on LABA/LAMA. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were used in 37.3% and systemic steroids (SCS) in 10.3%. 35.7 % had had at least one exacerbation, with hospitalisation, in the previous year. There was no spirometry data for 23.2%. On hospitalisation, 98.5% of patients were treated with oxygen and 38.3% with non-invasive ventilation. Additionally, 93.4% used SCS and 60.2% ICS. Antibiotics were administered to 85.2%. 95.4% of patients were discharged; 9 died, 5 of whom had a COPD-related death. The median length of stay was 12 days for discharged patients and 33 days for patients who died. At discharge, 79.1% were prescribed with LAMA, 63.6% SCS, 61.5% LABA and 55.6% LAMA+LABA. 26,2% were prescribed with ICS+LABA+LAMA. At follow-up, 44.4% had a scheduled medical appointment within the 60 days after being discharged, and 28.3% were later readmitted due to exacerbation, of whom 52.8% were hospitalised.\nConclusions\nThe severity of COPD, particularly in exacerbations, is directly related to impaired lung function and quality of life, mortality, and significant health system costs. Knowledge about COPD exacerbations' management in acute hospital admissions in Portugal may help stimulate a national discussion and review of existing data to engage clinicians, policymakers, managers, and patients, raising awareness and promoting action on COPD.\nKeywords:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nCOPD\nExacerbations\nDisease management\nFull Text\nIntroduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbimortality worldwide, imposing substantial individual, social and economic burdens. Its impact is expected to rise in the upcoming decades due to the continued exposure to risk factors and an accelerated ageing population.\n1\u20137\nAlthough epidemiological data are irregularly distributed worldwide, the estimated worldwide COPD mean prevalence is 13.1% (95% CI 10.2\u201315.6%), and 12.4% in Europe (95% CI 8.8\u201316.0%).\n8\nWith the change of smoking habits in recent decades, and although still higher in men, the prevalence and mortality of COPD have increased more rapidly in women.\n9\nDue to its high prevalence and chronicity, COPD causes substantial resource utilisation with frequent visits to clinicians, frequent hospitalisations due to acute exacerbations, and the need for chronic therapy, creating significant challenges for healthcare systems.\n2\n,\n5\n,\n10\nAvailable therapy can improve symptoms and quality of life and prevent acute worsening of the disease.\n4\nLikewise, COPD-appropriate management can decrease symptoms (especially dyspnea), reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, hospitalisations and readmissions, improve health status and exercise capacity, and prolong patient survival.\n5\n,\n11\u201315\nRecently, there has been great interest in the study of COPD phenotypes and with the personalization of the treatment of COPD based on a phenotypical approach, there has been a change in non-pharmacological and pharmacological management of COPD.\n16\nA better knowledge of the clinical performance and the identification of different factors associated with patients' outcomes are crucial to improving the quality of care for COPD patients\n17\n.\nFurthermore, understanding all levels of standard practice can provide an opportunity for targeted quality improvement interventions that could significantly impact patients' care.\n18\nSeveral observational studies, have shown COPD management in real-life setting and provide useful information for establishing appropriate clinical care. Esteban and colleagues identified that dyspnoea at baseline was the main variable associated with 30-day mortality after an emergency department evaluation for exacerbation of COPD, followed by the presence of cardiac disease, age, use of inspiratory accessory muscle/ paradoxical breathing, and the Glasgow Coma Scale score.\n19\nAnother study found that the factors associated with a higher probability of hospital admission of COPD patients due to respiratory causes were smoking and receiving oxygen therapy, whereas re-admissions were associated with being men, aged 70 years and over, and a smoker.\n20\nThese factors, as shown by Terzano and colleagues have implications to the length and cost of hospitalization.\n21\nThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical practice, clinical factors, and the outcomes of patients admitted for COPD exacerbations in Portuguese hospitals. Secondary objectives included characterisation of disease profile in hospitalised patients, the assessment of treatment and resources used; patients' outcomes assessment at 60-days after hospital discharge; and compliance with the GOLD guidelines' appraisal.\nMaterial and methods\nStudy design\nObservational, multicentre, prospective study with a 60-days follow-up period.\nPopulation\nMale and female patients aged \u2265 30 years, admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours due to an acute exacerbation of COPD, who have given their written informed consent for study participation.\nData collection and study assessments\nDuring the screening phase of 16-weeks, all consecutive cases admitted to hospital with a suspicion of a COPD exacerbation were identified upon admission, and the patients were invited to participate in the study. At discharge, if COPD exacerbation was confirmed as the cause of admission and the eligibility criteria were met, the patient was included in the study. The data were retrospectively recorded).\nFor eligible patients, demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, patients' referral, smoking habits, hospital readmissions, pulmonary function, comorbidities, and specific data on COPD as COPD symptoms and treatment. At follow-up, 60 \u00b1 7 days after discharge, COPD exacerbations management, outcome measures, and readmission data were evaluated through a structured phone interview. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalisation, hospital readmissions, and mortality at 60-days after hospital discharge.\nEthical aspects\nThis study was approved by the study sites' institutional review boards or ethics committees.\nThe work described has been carried out according to the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical and Pharmacoepidemiological Practices, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and maintaining patients' confidentiality.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all individual participants involved in the study.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Mean, median and interquartile range were used for quantitative variables and the absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative ones. Statistical analysis was performed with R software.\nResults\nSites and recruitment\nEleven hospitals participated in the study, and between December 2016 and July 2017, 196 patients were included (\nTable 1\n). The follow-up period was complete on 30\nth\nSeptember 2017.\nTable 1.\nParticipant hospitals and recruitment.\nSites\nn (%)\nCHUCB \u2013 Hospital P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3\n20 (10.2)\nCHULC \u2013 Hospital de Santa Marta\n15 (7.7)\nCHUSJ \u2013 Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o\n17 (8.7)\nCHTMAD \u2013 Hospital S.

Ex-smokers and active smokers represented 51.0% and 35.7% of the sample, respectively, and 35.7% had been hospitalized at least once for COPD exacerbation in the preceding year. Charlson's comorbidities index score was between 1 and 3 for 77.5% and \u22654 for 16.8% of the enrolled patients. Regarding respiratory symptoms, 54.1% of the admitted patients presented worsening dyspnea, increased sputum production, and change in sputum colour; 24.5% with only one symptom (96.9% with worsening dyspnea, 71.9% had increased sputum production, and 55.6% a change in sputum colour).

Although patients met the study inclusion criteria, due to informatics difficulties in some hospitals, spirometry data records were missing for 23.2% of the patients.\nTable 3.\nTreatment at hospital admission (last 30 days), during hospitalisation, and at hospital discharge.\nn (%)\nHospital admission\nHospitalisation\nHospital discharge\nn=185 previously treated\nn=196\nn=187\nSABA\n54 (29.2)\n185 (94.4)\n61 (32.6)\nLABA\n101 (54.6)\n115 (61.5)\nSAMA\n34 (18.4)\n189 (96.4)\n33 (17.6)\nLAMA\n134 (72.4)\n148 (79.1)\nICS+LABA\n82 (44.3)\n74 (39.6)\nICS\n69 (37.3)\n118 (60.2)\n66 (35.3)\nSCS\n19 (10.3)\n183 (93.4)\n119 (63.6)\nTheophylline\nOral\n66 (35.7)\n77 (41.2)\nIV\n49 (25.0)\nAntibiotics\n24 (13.0)\n167 (85.2)\n25 (13.4)\nVentilation\n79 (40.3)\nNIMV\n33 (17.8)\n75 (38.3)\n54 (28.9)\nInvasive ventilation\n3 (1.5)\nInvasive+NIMV\n1 (0.5)\nOxygen therapy\n82 (44.3)\n193 (98.5)\n106 (56.7)\nDiuretics\n117 (59.7)\nOther\n67 (34.2)\n44 (23.5)\nICS - inhaled corticosteroids, IV \u2013 intravenous, LABA - long-acting \u03b22-adrenoceptor, LAMA - long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists, NIMV - noninvasive mechanical ventilation, SABA - short-acting beta-agonist, SAMA - short-acting anticholinergic, SCS - systemic corticosteroids.\nHospitalisation\nMost patients were on oxygen therapy (98.5%), and 38.3% were treated with non-invasive ventilation. Additionally, 93.4% used SCS and 60.2% ICS. Antibiotics were also a regular part of treatment and were administered to 85.2% of the patients (\nTable 3\n).\nNine patients died during hospitalization, five of whom had a COPD-related death. The median length-of-hospitalization (\u00b1SD) was 12 \u00b1 10 days for discharged patients (95.4%) and 33 \u00b1 16 days for patients who died.\nHospital discharge\nOxygen therapy was prescribed to 56.7% of discharged patients. At discharge, 79.1% of the patients were prescribed LAMA, 63.6% SCS and 61.5% LABA; 55.6% LAMA+LABA, 51.0% of which were also prescribed an ICS; and 26.2% were prescribed ICS+LABA+ LAMA (\nTable 3\n). Spirometry results were available for 5.9% of the patients.\nA medical appointment and exams were scheduled within 60 days after discharge for 94.1% (n=176) and 27.3% (n=51) of the discharged patients.\n60 days follow-up\nFollow-up was completed for 96.3% (n=180) of the discharged patients. Three patients died after hospital discharge; two of these deaths were COPD-related.\nOf the 187 discharged patients, 44.4% (n=83) had the medical appointment scheduled at discharge, and 28.3% (n=53) were admitted to the emergency department due to a COPD exacerbation. From these, 52.8% (n=28) were hospitalised.

COPD exacerbations are a major cause of the high 30-day hospital readmission rates associated with COPD.\n14\nSevere COPD exacerbations that result in hospitalisation can be up to 60 times more expensive than mild or moderate exacerbations managed by primary care services.\n25\nMoreover, exacerbations are associated with impaired lung function and quality of life, mortality, and significant health system costs, accounting for the greatest proportion of the total COPD burden on healthcare systems.\n6\n,\n7\n,\n14\n,\n18\n,\n26\nMorbidity measures traditionally include physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Available data indicate that COPD morbidity increases with age and may be affected by concurrent chronic conditions that are smoking-, ageing- and COPD-related, which may interfere with disease management and are the primary drivers of hospitalisations, and costs for patients with COPD.\n6\n,\n27\u201330\nPatients with COPD have a mortality rate higher than the general population, depending on their disease severity.\n31\n,\n32\nHowever, the reduced accuracy of mortality data is associated with the under-recognition and under-diagnosis of COPD, which, together with the uncertainty of diagnosis, contribute to underestimating the disease and its burden.\n2\n,\n6\n,\n26\n,\n33\nThe high prevalence of COPD coupled with the widespread under-recognition and under-diagnosis of the disease stresses the need to raise COPD awareness.\n34\n,\n35\nAiming to know the Portuguese reality regarding COPD, COPD exacerbations and its management, and to compare it with the GOLD guidelines, this study analysed the participating hospitals' clinical outcomes and organisational data, providing evidence to support a better organization of patients\u2019 care and improved use of resources within Portugal.\nConsistently with the literature, the patients included in the study were mostly older men (mean age 71 years old, male to female ratio 6:1), a third of whom still smoked, with moderate to severe spirometric disease, a history of hospitalisation for COPD exacerbations and several comorbidities.\nReadmissions for recurrence of exacerbations in this population were also frequent, as found by the European COPD audit involving > 400 hospitals that reported a 90-day readmission rate of 35.1%.\n36\nSimilar results were found in the ECLIPSE study, in which COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission were relatively frequent events occurring in about 30% of patients during the 3-year follow-up.\n37\nIn Portugal, frequent acute exacerbations were reported by 38.0% of stable COPD outpatients over 40 years old.\n38\nThe mortality was lower than in previous studies involving these patients (exacerbators with poor lung function).\n37\nThis difference might be explained by the more common use of non-invasive ventilation in Portuguese hospitals, shown to reduce mortality in COPD patients.\n39\n,\n40\nNasal high flow oxygen therapy has been used for the management of respiratory failure, complementarily and as an alternative non-invasive respiratory support.\n41\nHowever, little and limited evidence for improved clinical outcomes is currently available.\nTelemonitoring can be important to predict exacerbations by monitoring symptoms and biological variables such as oximetry, physical activity and temperature. It may also be useful in post-exacerbation discharge and to avoid re-aggravation of symptoms and re-exacerbations.\n42\nCompliance with GOLD guidelines regarding diagnosis was established, as COPD diagnosis was considered for patients with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease, and a post-bronchodilator FEC\n1\n/FVC < 0.70 confirming the presence of persistent airflow limitation. To define therapy, COPD assessment must consider the presence and severity of spirometric abnormalities, current nature and magnitude of patients' symptoms, exacerbation history, and risk of future events, namely exacerbations, hospital admissions, death, and presence of comorbidities.\n12\nPharmacologic therapy for COPD is used to treat symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance and health status. The factors associated with successful treatment should be considered, not only those relying on patients, but also on health-care providers and on the relation between them. One study in Portuguese COPD patients showed that the adherence to medication was higher in patients with more symptoms and more obstructed, whereas previous COPD exacerbations improved prescribers\u2019 adherence to treatment guidelines.\n43\nHowever, it failed to prove a positive association between non-adherence to medication, inhalers mishandling or prescribers\u2019 non-adherence to GOLD strategy with symptoms, exacerbations, and airflow limitation.\n43\nIn this study, the medications used to treat COPD included bronchodilators LABAs and/or LAMAs and ICS, and recommended treatments ranged from a single short-or long-acting bronchodilator to combinations of two bronchodilators and ICS. This is compliant with the international guidelines regarding in-hospital treatment and shows a high standard of care.\n6\n,\n12\n,\n26\n,\n44\nThe small sample size is the main limitation of the study. Although the incidence of COPD is high, the Portuguese centres still have some difficulties to overcome in the development of clinical investigation studies, including the low organisational capacity which causes some barriers to the recruitment of patients. Additionally, in some hospitals, these organisational problems include difficulties with informatics, and there was a lack of information, namely spirometric data, not because they did not exist, but because they were unavailable at the moment of data registry for the study. The development of studies with these characteristics may help to professionalise clinical investigation and, ultimately, with more knowledge about the global panorama, to improve patients\u2019 care.\nConclusions\nThe presented COPD study evaluated COPD exacerbations' management in acute hospital admissions in Portugal, aiming to raise the standards of care to a level consistent with the GOLD management guidelines. Furthermore, the results obtained from this study may help stimulate a national discussion and review of existing data to engage clinicians, policymakers, managers, and patients, raising awareness and promoting action on COPD.\nReferences\n[1]\nEuropean Respiratory Society.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nEuropean Lung White Book, (2021),\nhttps://www.erswhitebook.org/chapters/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/\n[2]\nAS Buist, MA McBurnie, WM Vollmer, S Gillespie, P Burney, DM Mannino,\net al\n.\nInternational variation in the prevalence of COPD (The BOLD Study): a population-based prevalence study.\nLancet, 370 (2007), pp. 741-750\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61377-4\n[3]\nM Xie, X Liu, X Cao, M Guo, X.

Our objective was to obtain an overview of the characteristics, resources, techniques and behaviors in national interventional pulmonology (IP) units, before and after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\nMaterials and Methods\nAn online survey was developed by an expert panel with a total of 46 questions comprising the specifications of each unit, namely physical space, equipment, staff, procedure planning, monitoring, technical differentiation, and numbers pre- and post-COVID-19. Forty-one interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate between April and May 2021.\nResults\n37 units (90.2%) responded to the survey. The majority (64.9%) have a fully dedicated space with a weekly presence of \u22653 chest physicians (82.1%) and support of an anesthesiologist on specific days (48.6%). There is marked heterogeneity in the IP unit's equipment, and 56.8% acquired disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Pre-bronchoscopy hemogram, platelet count and coagulation tests are regularly asked by more than 90% of the units, even when deep sedation or biopsies are not planned. In 97.3% of cases, topical anesthesia and midazolam are utilized. Propofol (21.6%) and fentanyl (29.7%) are occasionally employed in some institutions. Most units use ancillary sampling techniques to diagnose central or peripheral lesions, with radial EBUS being used for guidance of distal procedures in 37.8% of centers, linear EBUS and EUS-B-FNA for mediastinal diagnosis and/or staging in 45.9% and 27.0% of units, respectively. Cryobiopsies are used by 21.6% of respondents to diagnose diffuse lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in 37.8% of centers. There was a decrease in the number of flexible (\np\n< 0.001) and rigid (\np\n= 0.005) bronchoscopies and an upscale of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nConclusions\nIP units have variable bronchoscopic practices, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they complied with most international recommendations, as elective procedures were postponed and PPE levels increased.\nKEYWORDS:\nBronchoscopy\nCOVID-19\nSurvey\nQuestionnaire\nPulmonology\nFull Text\nIntroduction\nBronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (IP) has evolved significantly in the last 20 years, with the development of technologies and practices. Despite the existence of several guidelines from international associations and institutions, most are recommendations set by experts in this field and more focused on safety and functional aspects than in robust scientific evidence, so procedures are usually not standardised.\n1\u20137\nConsidering the existing variance of methods and the little knowledge about bronchoscopy practices, several countries undertook national surveys to characterize the availability of resources, the clinical application of techniques, and its specificities.\n8\u201315\nIn 2018, a national study was published evaluating, specifically, the use of pleuroscopy in Portuguese pulmonology departments, considering availability, professionals\u2019 experience and training, number of procedures and its characteristics.\n16\nRecently, because of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, the Portuguese Pulmonology Society published a consensus statement aiming at the safety of both patients, medical practitioners and other health professionals during bronchoscopy and pleural procedures.\n17\nBased on current knowledge, all patients should be assumed as potentially infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); therefore, specific measures must be implemented, including organizational issues, physical space and material preparation, and personal protection equipment (PPE) of all professionals involved.\n17\nThese recent changes in the bronchology field were expected to have a major impact on national interventional pulmonology units, so the Committee on Endoscopic Techniques of the Portuguese Pulmonology Society nominated a working group to conduct a national survey, to accurately characterize the Portuguese panorama. Specifically, this survey aimed to quantify and qualify the human and technical resources of the Portuguese Pulmonology Departments, the specificities of the bronchoscopic procedures performed, and compare the reality before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods\nThe expert panel developed a structured questionnaire in Google Forms, and the link was e-mailed to the Bronchology Units or Pulmonology Departments of all Portuguese public hospitals and some private institutions/hospitals considering their representativeness (\nSupplementary Table 1\n). Respondents had one month to reply and send the completed form; one reminder was sent to all, and those who did not answer were further contacted by phone. The survey occurred between 22\nnd\nApril and 31\nst\nMay 2021.\nThe questionnaire comprised 46 questions, either of quantitative or multiple option answer, considering the following sections: 1) respondent and hospital identification; 2) Interventional Pulmonology Unit characterization; 3) staff experience in bronchology; 4) nursing and 5) anesthesiology support; 6) equipment characterization; 7) planning and monitoring of the bronchoscopic procedures, including procedure specifications (e.g. complementary diagnostic tests before bronchoscopy, methods of sedation and patient monitoring); 8) endoscopist PPE pre and post the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic; 9) accessory diagnostic and therapy techniques by flexible bronchoscopy, including the number of procedures pre and post COVID-19; and 10) rigid bronchoscopy, comprising the number of procedures pre and post COVID-19.\nResponses were downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet. Descriptive analysis was performed using the software SPSSv24\u00ae. The survey results were analyzed based on the total number of answers to each question and are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation and median (range) for continuous variables, and as frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Paired samples t-student test was used to compare the means of two variables of the same sample measured in sequential years. A difference of at least 5% (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 41 eligible Portuguese interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate (\nSupplementary table 1\n), and 37 (90.2%) answered the entire online questionnaire. The responders included in this analysis are listed by their district in\nFig. 1\nand represent almost all geographic locations in the country\n.\nFig. 1.\nParticipating centers\u2019 geographical distribution.\n(0.12MB).\nGeneral characterization of the IP units\nThe units were located on nine university public hospitals, 23 tertiary public hospitals, and two private hospitals. In 24 cases (64.9%), the unit space was fully dedicated to bronchoscopy/pleural procedures; in 12 (32.4%), the physical location was shared with other specialties, and in one case, the procedures were performed in a hospital operating room.\nThirty IP units (81.1%) reported the weekly presence of three or more chest physicians performing the procedures, six (16.2%) had the regular presence of two pulmonologists, and one (2.7%) relied on one doctor.\nRegarding the existence of dedicated nurses with specific IP training, three units (8.1%) stated the usual presence of one nurse, 13 (35.1%) referred two rotating nurses, ten units (27%) three nurses, and another 10 (27%), four or more nurses. One unit indicated the absence of trained nurses.\nEighteen units (48.6%) had the regular support of an anesthesiologist on specific weekdays. In 15 cases (40.5%), an anesthesiologist was present in the bronchoscopy suite-only upon request. This occurred on 1-2 days/week in 16 cases, 3-4 days/week in two cases and five days/week in other two units (totally dedicated to cancer patients). Four units (10.8%) had no assistance from an anesthesiologist.\nOn a regular year, the IP units reported an average of nearly 500 flexible bronchoscopies per year. However, great heterogeneity was observed with 14 centers (37.8%) registering 500 exams/year or more, 18 (48.6%) 200 to 499 exams/year and five (13,5%) less than 200 exams/year.\nOverall, we were able to analyze the profile of 103 pulmonologists. Of these, 41 (39.8%) had over 15 years of experience in bronchoscopy, 23 (22.3%) had 10 to 14 years of previous experience, 25 (24.3%) had 5 to 9 years, and 14 (13.6%) had less than 5 five years of IP experience. Concerning the areas of expertise, all answering chest physicians had experience in flexible bronchoscopy, while 37 (35.9%) reported proficiency in rigid bronchoscopy and 37 (35.9%) in endobronchial ultrasound.\nPleuroscopy/medical thoracoscopy was performed by 46 (44.6%) of the respondents and was reported to be available in 20 centers.\nTable 1\nshows the unit's equipment. Most units (56.8%) promoted the acquisition of disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Twenty-five health care facilities (67.6%) reported using automatic high-level disinfection to reprocess their reusable bronchoscopes and accessories. In 11 hospitals (29.7%), sterilization was the reported selected method, if available, because of its greater efficacy in reducing microorganism's contamination. In one unit (2.7%), the cleaning and disinfection of the equipment was entirely manual. After reprocessing, to minimize the likelihood of recontamination, the equipment was stored in ventilated cabinets in 19 units (51.4%) and in non-ventilated facilities in 18 units (48.6%).\nTable 1.\nIP units\u2019 equipment.\nNumber of IP units\n%\nVideo bronchoscopes\n36\n97.3\nOptical bronchoscopes\n27\n73.0\nDisposable bronchoscopes\n21\n56.8\nLinear endobronchial ultrasound\n16\n43.2\nRadial endobronchial ultrasound\n14\n37.8\nRigid bronchoscope\n17\n45.9\nThoracoscopy (semi-rigid or rigid)\n23\n62.2\nFluoroscopy (dedicated or shared)\n10\n27.0\nElectrosurgery / electrocautery\n11\n29.7\nArgon-plasma coagulation\n10\n27.0\nCryotherapy\n10\n27.0\nLaser therapy\n8\n21.6\nElectromagnetic navigation\n2\n5.4\nAuto-fluorescence\n2\n5.4\nCone-beam CT\n1\n2.7\nPatient preparation, monitoring, anesthesia and sedation\nMost participants (86.5%) responded that they usually ask for at least one pre-procedural exam to evaluate each patient that is going to be submitted to a standard flexible bronchoscopy without deep sedation/anesthesia when the main purpose is the inspection of the airways and sample collection without the need for biopsies. Similarly, most proceduralists (89.2%) require more than one pre-procedure complimentary exam when sedation or biopsies are planned\nTable 2\n. presents the complementary exams asked in each situation.\nTable 2.\nPre-procedural complementary exams required when performing standard flexible bronchoscopy.\nUsually\nSometimes\nNever\nStandard flexible bronchoscopy, without deep sedation/anesthesia and without biopsy (n)\nHemogram with leukogram\n35\n2\n0\nPlatelet count\n35\n1\n1\nCoagulation tests\n32\n4\n1\nSerum urea and creatinine\n26\n9\n2\nLiver enzymes\n12\n22\n3\nSerum ionogram\n17\n16\n4\nElectrocardiogram\n17\n16\n4\nEchocardiogram\n0\n12\n25\nChest x-ray\n37\n0\n0\nChest CT\n25\n11\n1\nPET-CT scan\n0\n16\n21\nStandard flexible bronchoscopy, with deep sedation/anesthesia and/or need for biopsy (n)\nHemogram with leukogram\n36\n1\n0\nPlatelet count\n36\n1\n0\nCoagulation tests\n34\n3\n0\nSerum urea and creatinine\n32\n4\n1\nLiver enzymes\n23\n12\n2\nSerum ionogram\n27\n9\n1\nElectrocardiogram\n32\n4\n1\nEchocardiogram\n2\n21\n14\nChest x-ray\n32\n5\n0\nChest CT\n33\n4\n0\nPET-CT scan\n0\n24\n13\nMost flexible bronchoscopies were reported to be performed with topical anesthesia (with or without conscious sedation) using lidocaine in the form of gel (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 30, 81.1%; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 6, 16.2%), nebulized (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 27, 73%; or \u201csometimes\u201c\nn\n= 7, 18.9%), and/or liquid in the tracheobronchial tree as \u201cspray as you go\u201d technique (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 19, 51.4%; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 6, 16.2%). The most common drug used by the pulmonologists for sedation was midazolam in 97.3% of units (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 25, or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 11). Propofol and fentanyl were occasionally employed during bronchoscopy in 8 (21.6%) and 11 (29.7%) institutions, respectively.\nTwenty-nine respondents (78.4%) affirmed that supplemental oxygen was routinely administered since the beginning of each flexible bronchoscopy. In contrast, the remaining eight (21.6%) participants showed a preference in administering supplemental oxygen only if required due to peripheral oxygen desaturation during the procedure.\nWhen asked about the patient's monitoring during flexible bronchoscopy without deep sedation, all 37 participants referred to assessing heart rate and pulse oximetry throughout the procedure. Non-invasive blood pressure was measured by 33 respondents (89.2%), and ECG monitoring was monitored by 23 participants (62.2%).\nWhen deep sedation was planned, end-tidal CO\n2\nwas evaluated by one participant unit (2.7%), monitor ECG was performed by 31 participants (83.8%), non-invasive blood pressure by 35 (94.6%), and all respondents referred to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry. In both scenarios, one respondent added clinical observation, and another external pace defibrillator monitoring.\nBronchoscopy technical features\nRegarding the diagnosis of central/tracheobronchial lesions by flexible bronchoscopy, biopsy forceps were used by all 37 participant units; bronchial brushings by 36 (97.3%); and needle aspiration by 31 (83.8%). Bronchial cryobiopsies were reported by seven (18.9%) participants.\nCryobiopsies were also the least reported procedure in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions, used by six (16.2%) respondents. Peripheral biopsy forceps and brushing were among the most used procedures for diagnosing peripheral lesions, reported by 33 (89.1%) participants in both cases. Radial EBUS and fluoroscopy were used as guidance for distal procedures in 14 (37.8%) and 10 (27.0%) centers, respectively.\nIn diffuse lung diseases, bronchoalveolar lavage was the preferred method, reported by all 37 centers. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were used by 33 (89.2%) of the participants, while eight centers (21.6%) reported performing transbronchial lung cryobiopsies. Fluoroscopy was used by seven centers (18.9%) to guide the adjunctive procedures for the diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases.\nIn what concerns the diagnosis of mediastinal lesions, non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was used by 32 centers (86.5%). In contrast, EBUS-TBNA was used by 17 centers (45.9%) and EUS-B-FNA in 10 centers (27.0%).\nConcerning therapeutic techniques, 34 (91.9%) centers reported using flexible bronchoscopy to remove foreign bodies. Control of hemoptysis was attempted through balloon tamponade by 30 (81.0%) centers, whereas 31 (83.8%) units used some form of thermal energy, of which LASER was the preferred, employed by 14 (37.8%) centers, followed by argon-plasma coagulation, used by 10 (27.0%) centers. Airway repermeabilization through self-expandable stents placed through flexible bronchoscopy was reported by 7 (18.9%) centers.\nOther endobronchial therapeutic maneuvers such as bronchial thermoplasty and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (with one-way valves, coils or thermal ablation) were not reported by any center.\nThe average number of flexible bronchoscopies reported to have been performed by all 37 participant centers in 2020 (amid the COVID-19 pandemic) was 345 (\u00b1249). When asked about the estimated annual number of flexible bronchoscopies performed during 2019 (before the pandemic), the reported average number was 500 (\u00b1346). There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of bronchoscopies performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised to an average of -155 (\np\n< 0.001). The distribution of reported exams and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of flexible bronchoscopy is reported in detail in\nTable 3\n. In 2020, on average, 84% (\u00b112.6%) of flexible bronchoscopy procedures were performed mainly with a diagnostic intent.\nTable 3.\nEstimated annual number of flexible bronchoscopies in 2019 and 2020.\nNumber of flexible bronchoscopies\nReported number of centers (2019)\nReported number of centers (2020)\n>1000\n4\n1\n\u2265500-999\n10\n8\n\u2265250-499\n13\n14\n\u2265100-249\n10\n10\n<100\n0\n4\nSeventeen IP units reported to have a rigid bronchoscope and 14 referred to perform the procedure. Proceduralists used rigid bronchoscopy to conduct one or more adjunctive procedures: 100% mechanical debulking (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 12; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 2); 57.1% LASER ablation (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 7; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 1); 57.1% argon-plasma coagulation (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 6; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 2); 50% electrosurgery (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 3; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 4); 50% cryoablation (\u201cusually\u201d\nn\n= 2; or \u201csometimes\u201d\nn\n= 5).\nEleven centers (29.7%) reported airway stenting deployment by rigid bronchoscopy to maintain tracheobronchial patency. Between all commercially available, the Dumon (straight or Y) and Hood stents were the most frequently used in the Portuguese IP units (Dumon\nn\n= 11, Hood\nn\n= 8, Ultraflex\nn\n= 5, Polyflex\nn\n= 4, Silmet\nn\n= 4, Dynamic Y-stent\nn\n= 3, Montgomery T-tube\nn\n= 3, Aerstent\nn\n= 2, Micro-tech\nn\n= 1, Noppen\nn\n= 1 unit). Several airway stent complications were commonly reported by most centers, being the most frequent: stent migration (\nn\n= 11), obstruction by secretions (\nn\n= 10), obstruction by granulation tissue (\nn\n= 10), chronic cough (\nn\n= 5), and infection (\nn\n= 3).\nOf these 14 units performing rigid bronchoscopy, 11 retrieved their estimated annual number of procedures performed both in 2020 and also on a regular year (before the COVID-19 pandemic). On average, IP units performed 96\u00b199.3 (range 7-302) rigid bronchoscopies during 2019 (before the pandemic), whereas in 2020, the average number of reported rigid bronchoscopy was 70\u00b181.2 (range 0-237). When assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rigid bronchoscopy overall workload, a statistically significant average decrease of \u201326 procedures was observed (\np\n= 0.005).\nHealth professionals' protection\nWhen asked about the current use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during interventional bronchoscopy, all 37 units confirmed choosing FFP2/N95 single-use face masks (four in combination with a surgical face mask), some sort of eye protection, single-use gown and single-use waterproof gloves\nTable 4\n. presents the standard PPE reported to be used in 2019 (before the pandemic) and afterwards.\nTable 4.\nStandard PPE reported before and after COVID-19 pandemic.\nPPE\nReported number of centers (2019)\nReported number of centers (2020)\nFFP2/N95\n21\n37\nSurgical mask\n19\n4\nHair protection\n20\n34\nEye protection\n21\n37\nWaterproof gown\n12\n34\nNon-waterproof gown\n22\n3\nSterile gloves\n18\n23\nNon-sterile gloves\n17\n18\nShoe-cover\n9\n25\nLeg protection\n1\n10\nDiscussion\nThis survey identifies a marked heterogeneity of bronchoscopy practice and resources in adults IP units across Portugal's mainland. This was a comprehensive and extended questionnaire that was able to assess the prevalence of the practice in the country and the impact of COVID-19 at a national level. It is evident that the number and type of procedures performed decreased during the pandemic period; most units equipped themselves with disposable bronchoscopes, and there was a shift in the type and level of protective equipment used to increase safety for staff and patients.\nSurveys in IP have been published since the 90s.\n10\nWhen compared to some historical questionnaires that were able to provide the clinical picture of bronchoscopy in North America and in some European countries, much as evolved regarding practice and technical developments. The number and indications of rigid bronchoscopies have declined, new techniques have emerged (e.g., EBUS and cryobiopsies), sedation and anesthesia are now regarded as mandatory in most units and demanded by patients.\nThe survey response rate was very high, and the findings reveal, as expected, the national panorama, in which the majority of centers are based in Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas and in the coastal region, where more than half of the Portuguese population lives.\n18\nMost units (65%) are fully dedicated to bronchoscopy, more than 90% have two or more trained pulmonologists, and in 84% of cases, at least one has at least ten years of IP experience. In contrast, 46% of units have two or fewer nurses, and most of them are not fully dedicated to bronchoscopy. It is worth mentioning that there is no specific post-graduation education in IP for nurses in the country. We may speculate that the small number of nurses trained and committed to this area may impact the quality of the exams. The British Thoracic Society advised the presence of at least two qualified nurses during bronchoscopy.\n1\nIn contrast, the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society instruct on the need for one to two dedicated nurses during interventional pulmonology procedures without anesthesia (with a third nurse required to help the anesthesiologist in the procedures performed under deep sedation / general anesthesia).\n2\nTherefore, efforts should be made to assure that nursing staff receives adequate standardized training in IP and that all units move on to comply with international recommendations and demand the regular presence of an adequate number of trained nurses. This number may vary depending on the workflow volume of the individual units. Still, it should not be less than two (with possible rotation) in low volume units, to at least three (non-rotating) in high volume units that perform advanced interventional bronchoscopy and have regular anesthesiology support.\nThere is great heterogeneity in technical resources and equipment between IP units, with more than half performing only basic exams. A third uses rigid bronchoscopy, which is sufficient for the country necessities, according to the number of habitants. In 2019, 16 centers performed linear EBUS, whereas in 2014 only six did it, as reported by the Survey of Pulmonology Services, prepared as part of the review of the Pulmonology Referral Network.\n19\nThis expansion follows the natural evolution of IP units worldwide since EBUS is an important tool for mediastinal staging in lung cancer patients and in diagnosing malignant or benign lesions adjacent to the tracheobronchial tree or the oesophagus.\n20\nFor the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules, 14 units have radial EBUS, ten fluoroscopy and two have electromagnetic navigation, which enables an increase in diagnostic accuracy. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 56.8% of the units now have single-use bronchoscopes, which were not regularly utilized. This equipment will certainly have an increasing application in the near future due to its benefits regarding the risk of contamination, availability and preserved efficacy in most emergent clinical scenarios.\n21\nConcerning the number of procedures per year, the present survey shows a clear negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period, with a decrease by 30% on the average number of flexible bronchoscopies and 27% on rigid bronchoscopies. This is in line with other published studies,\n22\u201324\nwhere IP procedure work-load considerably decreased or was even abolished during the COVID-19 era. Elective procedures in COVID-19 negative patients were postponed and rescheduled as recommended by consensus guidelines.\n17\n,\n25\nSome kind of sedation/anesthesia is required to reduce patient's discomfort, enhance safety\n6\n,\n26\nreduce procedure duration and increase diagnostic accuracy. The preferred method for bronchoscopic diagnostic procedures is conscious sedation with antianxiety and/or analgesic medications, in combination with local anesthesia, titrated by bronchoscopists and supervised by the team. Most guidelines suggest the combination of a sedative agent with an opioid since it decreases cough and pain, improves patients\u2019 tolerance, and reduces the total dose of sedative drugs.\n27\nIn the present assessment, more than 97% of the IP units in the country confirmed the use of midazolam. Still, only 29.7% associated an opioid, probably due to a reduced experience with this medication and fear of complications in patients with previous respiratory diseases. These results are in-line with other real-life studies.\n11\n,\n28\nIt is worth mentioning that conscious sedation has limitations, and prolonged, complex, and technically demanding bronchoscopies or therapeutic procedures usually require deeper sedation/general anesthesia with the support of an anesthesiologist, not involved in the intervention itself.\n29\nThe survey identified the lack of available anesthesiologists as a potential problem, with only 5% and 48.6% of the units having the collaboration of this specialty on a daily or regular basis, respectively.\nAs pre-procedural requirements, nearly all responders ask routinely for a full blood count (97%), coagulation studies (92%), renal function (86%) and an electrocardiogram, even when there is no history of abnormal coagulation or cardiac risk. These numbers are much higher when compared to other published surveys. In 2002, in the United Kingdom, when performing bronchoscopy without transbronchial biopsy, physicians routinely asked for a full blood count in 57%, blood urea and electrolytes in 43% and clotting function in 18% of cases. When a transbronchial biopsy is needed, 91% asked for a full blood count and 88% asked for clotting tests.\n12\nThis highlights the deviation of real-life performance compared to international guidelines and current scientific literature, which states that the routine performance of coagulation studies, platelet counts, and hemoglobin levels before flexible bronchoscopy is not recommended, especially when there are no previous identifiable risk factors.\n26\n,\n30\nOn the other hand, a pre-procedural chest CT scan was not consistently required by 32,4% of participants. Though we acknowledge that a chest CT can be dismissed upon emergent situations (mainly emergent therapeutic bronchoscopy), the number of centers that reported inconsistent demand of this valuable exam was concerning. Again, we stress the need to standardize procedures and comply with international recommendations that underline the importance of CT in preparation for bronchoscopy.\n1\n,\n2\n,\n19\nClinical evaluation should dictate other pre-bronchoscopy investigations on an individual basis, and this should be stressed to avoid submitting the patients to unnecessary exams and increase healthcare costs.\nAccording to the recommendations of a few guidelines,\n26\n,\n30\nand good clinical practice, all Portuguese units monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation, and generally add non-invasive blood pressure and continuous ECG in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, especially when deep sedation is planned. It is recognized that deficient monitoring in deep sedation may lead to unnoticed respiratory depression, changes in normal blood pressure and arrhythmia, which increase the probability of complications during bronchoscopy. This awareness was acquired especially in the last two decades, compared to the survey conducted by Smyth et al, where only 22% and 10% of physicians reported monitoring ECG and blood pressure, respectively.\n12\nA recent systematic review by Strohleit et al,\n27\nreinforces the idea that there is still the need for further research in this area due to the scarcity of evidence of published papers.\nIn the current study, most units combine biopsy, brushing and needle aspiration for the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions, to obtain the highest diagnostic yield.\n31\nCompared to other published surveys that proved the underuse of TBNA,\n8\nwe highlight that 83.8% of centers are able to perform non-guided TBNA in central lesions and 86.5% in mediastinal lesions (including centers that also perform EBUS-TBNA). Interestingly, non-guided TBNA accuracy has been reported to benefit from previous EBUS training.\n32\nStill, we believe that the overlap of both techniques in the same centers can be explained by the formers\u2019 wider accessibility and lower costs. Although EBUS-TBNA is used in 45.9% of units, EUS-B-FNA is only performed in 27% of centers, probably related to the lack of specific training. This reinforces the need for educational programs in this area for both residents and senior chest physicians.\nIn this survey, transbronchial lung cryobiopsies were performed in a scarce number of hospitals (8 out of 37). This finding perhaps reflects the novelty of this procedure and the need to complete a high volume of procedures, which has been suggested as a requirement to gain and maintain adequate proficiency in this technique.\n33\nStill, considering transbronchial lung cryobiopsies, we found some important deviations of the current guidelines\n34\nand expert panel standardization recommendations\n35\nconcerning the utilization of fluoroscopic control, that according to our results, was not available in one center. This practice is not in line with the safety recommendations for this procedure. Though we could not assess other in-depth details, outcomes or complications, we strongly underline the need to comply with the currently available best practice recommendations\n34\n,\n35\nto avoid unnecessary risks.\nAnother important finding of our survey was the complete absence of offer, among all respondent centers, of two important and validated endobronchial therapies: bronchial thermoplasty (recommended for selected asthmatic patients in GINA grade 5 of symptomatic control, evidence B)\n36\nand bronchoscopic lung volume reduction strategies (recommended for selected emphysematous COPD patients with significant lung hyperinflation despite optimal medical care)\n37\n. The reasons for this finding are out of the scope of this paper but may include national regulatory and reimbursement issues that deserve prompt elucidation.\nThey are crucial regarding infectious control measures, since it has been proved that not sufficiently protected healthcare workers attending or performing aerosol-generating procedures have a higher risk of infection.\n38\nIn 2002, in the UK, a national survey reported that only 9% of physicians used four protective items: face mask, gloves, eye protection, and gown.\n12\nThe recommendations of PPE during bronchoscopy have been upscaled since 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and, again, most units comply with them. The awareness of safety issues of Portuguese bronchoscopists and staff attending the procedures increased noticeably after COVID-19, with 100% of centers using FFP2/N95 masks and eye protection. Recent studies have shown that most proceduralists understand the gravity of the situation and paid particular attention to the use of appropriate PPE,\n22\nbut in real clinical practice, and especially at the peak of the pandemic, some of the international recommendations were quite difficult to follow and implement.\n24\n,\n39\nIn recent articles, authors report that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be low with consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment by healthcare workers when all the measures are followed.\n40\n,\n41\nMeanwhile, on the 26th of November 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) designated the variant B.1.1.529 named Omicron as a variant of concern (VOC), with a considerable rise in cases of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa in regions where the Omicron variant emerged.\n42\n.This variant, considered to be more contagious and associated with an increase in the risk of reinfection after a primary infection than the previous mutations, shows more than 30 mutations leading to amino-acid changes in the Spike sequence.\n43\nThe question of severity and this new variant is not clear yet. However, it is suggested to be less aggressive.\n44\nPresently, there are too many confounding factors to compare patients with the Omicron variant with patients infected by other variants. In fact, COVID-19 severity and mortality vary enormously depending on the country, the prevalence of vaccination, the population's characteristics.\nFor these reasons, it is not expected that our level of care as healthcare workers will change in the near future.\nThere are some obvious limitations of our study and all surveys for that matter: answers rely on personal or unit databases and, in some instances, on the memory of participants (there is no national database); lack of objectivity of some responders; differences in question interpretation; replies could not be verified; some topics were simplified and others not covered, to reduce the overall length and avoid a reduced response rate. We also acknowledge that there were questions regarding duration of practice but non-related to training or competence maintenance, and the design questionnaire was not able to assess the quality of procedures which is at least as important as the numbers, equipment or techniques attributed to each unit.\nConclusion\nThe present survey assessed present trends and the impact of COVID-19 in bronchoscopy practices in Portugal. It does not provide any recommendations or IP standards as with other questionnaires. It suggests that IP units in the country have a wide range of characteristics and behaviors, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they complied with most international recommendations, as elective procedures were postponed and PPE levels increased.\nPractice in the bronchoscopy field was previously guided by personal experience, determined by the peculiarities of a particular unit as new members would mimic and adopt the attitudes of older practitioners. Nowadays, there is the need to standardize practice and enhance training and competence maintenance of IP physicians within the country. The current survey helps to understand the reality and may settle the foundations to improve the IP field in Portugal, with the development of a future national database, homogenize procedures and protocols, and even organize and design better training programs.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary table 1.

Up to 50% of patients                     have residual symptoms and physiologic impairment, particularly dyspnea and                     reduced diffusion capacity. Studies have also shown that 24%\u201354% of                     patients hospitalized during the 1st year of the pandemic exhibit radiologic                     abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacity, reticular opacity, bronchial                     dilatation, and air trapping, when imaged more than 1 year after infection. In                     patients with persistent respiratory symptoms but normal results at chest CT,                     dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT, xenon 129 MRI, and low-field-strength MRI were                     reported to show abnormal ventilation and/or perfusion, suggesting that some                     lung injury may not be detectable with standard CT. Histologic patterns in                     post\u2013COVID-19 lung disease include fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and                     vascular abnormality, indicating that different pathologic mechanisms may                     contribute to PCC. Therefore, a comprehensive imaging approach is necessary to                     evaluate and diagnose patients with persistent post\u2013COVID-19 symptoms.                     This review will focus on the long-term findings of clinical and radiologic                     abnormalities and describe histopathologic perspectives. It also addresses                     advanced imaging techniques and deep learning approaches that can be applied to                     COVID-19 survivors. This field remains an active area of research, and further                     follow-up studies are warranted for a better understanding of the chronic stage                     of the disease and developing a multidisciplinary approach for patient                     management.\n\u00a9 RSNA, 2024\nDownload as PowerPoint\nSummary\nA comprehensive understanding of long-term respiratory sequelae, residual CT                     abnormalities, histopathologic findings, and novel imaging markers of chronic                     lung disease following COVID-19 pneumonia is essential for establishing                     effective multidisciplinary approaches to treat post-COVID-19 condition.\nEssentials\n\u25a0 Although most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia show                             gradual functional recovery, a subset of patients have persistent                             dyspnea and impaired pulmonary function, most notably reduced diffusion                             capacity, at more than 1 year of follow-up.\n\u25a0 Long-term residual CT abnormalities, including ground-glass                             opacity, reticular opacity, bronchial dilatation, and air trapping have                             been observed in 24%\u201354% of patients who had COVID-19 during the                             1st year of the pandemic, and these abnormalities are correlated with                             functional impairment; thus, CT surveillance can be recommended for                             symptomatic COVID-19 survivors.\n\u25a0 In patients with persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2                             infection and normal results at chest CT, dual-energy CT, xenon 129 MRI,                             and low-field-strength MRI can show abnormal ventilation and perfusion                             patterns, suggesting potential lung injury beyond CT-detectable                             structural changes.\n\u25a0 Heterogeneous histologic patterns of chronic lung disease after                             COVID-19 have been identified, including fibrosis, organizing pneumonia,                             and vascular abnormality, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive                             understanding and multidisciplinary approach for treating                             post\u2013COVID-19 condition.\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19 is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the acute disease                 usually lasts 4 weeks from symptom onset. However, some patients may experience                 persistent symptoms and delayed complications beyond this timeframe. In                 community-based surveys from both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients,                 symptoms were present in 15%\u201318% of patients beyond 4 weeks and in                 8%\u201317% beyond 12 weeks (\n1\n). The risk is                 more than twice as high in patients who had more severe illness requiring                 hospitalization or admission to the intensive care unit (\n2\n). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention termed the                 long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as \u201cpost\u2013COVID-19                 condition\u201d (PCC) or \u201clong COVID\u201d (\n3\n). These effects have also been termed \u201cpostacute                 sequelae of COVID-19,\u201d defined as ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms or                 conditions present 30 or more days after the infection (\n4\n). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)                 guidelines have categorized the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 as \u201congoing                 symptomatic COVID-19\u201d if they last 4\u201312 weeks and as                 \u201cpost-COVID syndrome\u201d if they persist beyond 12 weeks (\n5\n). The constellation of symptoms associated                 with PCC encompasses a broad range of respiratory and nonrespiratory manifestations,                 including but not limited to fatigue, muscle weakness, dyspnea, psychiatric                 disorders, and sleep disturbances (\n1\n,\n5\n,\n6\n), and                 may lead to substantial clinical and socioeconomic burden (\n1\n,\n5\n,\n7\n).\nLong-term respiratory sequelae of COVID-19 are a result of direct injury of the                 airway, alveolus, or endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature or the host\u2019s                 immune reaction to those injuries. For instance, inflammation of the airways can                 result in large and small airways disease in the form of bronchiectasis and                 constrictive bronchiolitis (\n8\n\u2013\n11\n). Furthermore, pulmonary vascular                 complications include a vasculopathy that results in vasoconstriction and                 microthrombi (\n12\n,\n13\n). In addition, diffuse alveolar damage can cause fibrotic                 changes in the lung parenchyma, leading to pulmonary fibrosis with associated                 reduction of the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D\nlco\n)                     (\n14\n\u2013\n18\n). All these sequelae can contribute to persistent symptoms,                 especially dyspnea, in patients with PCC (\n19\n,\n20\n).\nThe occurrence of PCC varies according to patient characteristics, including age,                 sex, pre-existing health conditions (eg, obesity and asthma), and viral factors                     (\n1\n,\n2\n,\n6\n). As such, patients with                 factors that put them at increased risk of COVID-19\u2013related pulmonary                 sequelae should be followed up to manage potential functional impairments. Imaging,                 particularly chest CT, plays an important role in the evaluation of pulmonary                 complications; thus, it is important for radiologists to understand pulmonary                 sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia and be familiar with the corresponding imaging                 findings. Although the underlying mechanisms and clinical course of chronic lung                 injury after COVID-19 remain partially undefined, an increasing body of literature                 has provided novel insights.\nIn this review of chronic lung injury after COVID-19 pneumonia, we aim to\n(a)\nsummarize CT findings in long-term follow-up studies of                 COVID-19 pneumonia and their clinical significance,\n(b)\nbriefly                 review the histopathologic abnormalities seen in chronic lung disease after                 COVID-19, and\n(c)\ndescribe novel imaging techniques and future                 directions in evaluating post\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia (\nFig 1\n). Most of the data in this review derive from follow-up                 of individuals who were hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic, but we                 have included a section on the impact of variants and vaccines on chronic lung                 injury after COVID-19.\nFigure 1:\nDiagram illustrates the clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic findings of                         chronic COVID-19 pneumonia. More than 1 year after initial COVID-19                         pneumonia, a subset of patients continues to experience persistent symptoms                         and exhibit chest CT abnormalities. The histopathologic characteristics of                         chronic lung injury resulting from COVID-19 pneumonia encompass a wide                         spectrum, including disrupted basement membrane, fibrosis and collagen                         deposition, microclots and vasculopathy, bronchiectasis, and small-airway                         disease. Residual CT abnormalities include bronchiectasis and/or                         bronchiolectasis, reticulation, air trapping at expiratory CT, and                         ground-glass opacities. Even when conventional CT scans show normal                         findings, photon-counting detector CT, xenon 129 (\n129\nXe) MRI, and                         low-field-strength MRI can potentially help identify subtle lung parenchymal                         abnormalities or functional impairment beyond the limits of anatomic                         resolution.

In most patients, despite having severe to critical                 COVID-19 pneumonia, the pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity improved during                 the follow-up period, which ranged from 1 to 2 years in the presented studies.                 However, 4%\u201348% of patients had persistently impaired pulmonary function at                 more than 1 year of follow-up. A recent study by Zhang et al (\n26\n) described lung function trajectories over 2 years in                 COVID-19 survivors and reported that although lung function tests improved                 6\u201312 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they declined during the 2nd year                 after infection, thus emphasizing the clinical necessity for long-term monitoring of                 respiratory function.\nTable 1:\nSummary of Studies on Dyspnea and Pulmonary Function Testing Abnormalities in                         Patients after Hospitalization for COVID-19 Pneumonia\nA series of studies (\n21\n\u2013\n26\n) have demonstrated decreased D\nlco\nto be the most prevalent long-term respiratory complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection                     (\nFig 2\n). Many studies have shown that                 oxygenation is impaired at 3 and 6 months after discharge in patients who were                 hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia (\n27\n\u2013\n30\n), and this                 phenomenon was consistently observed in longer-term follow-up studies exceeding 1                 year. Low D\nlco\ncould result from alveolar membrane disruption or pulmonary                 vascular abnormalities caused by COVID-19 (\n27\n,\n30\n). A recent study (\n31\n) demonstrated that the lung diffusing                 capacity for nitric oxide was also significantly affected at 1-year follow-up,                 suggesting a chronic alteration of alveolar membrane diffusive conductance due to                 SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have consistently reported that impaired D\nlco\nis more frequent in female than male patients (\n21\n,\n23\n\u2013\n25\n). Additional studies are necessary to                 clarify the associations between respiratory function, clinical trajectory, and                 long-term COVID-19 outcomes.\nFigure 2:\nImages in a 65-year-old male patient with persistent dyspnea more than 1 year                         after COVID-19 pneumonia.\n(A)\nAxial CT scan obtained 1 week                         after symptom onset shows diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO) (arrows) in                         both lungs.\n(B)\nAxial CT scan obtained 6 months after hospital                         admission for COVID-19 shows decreased GGO but residual bronchial                         dilatation, reticular opacity, and parenchymal bands (dashed circles).\n(C)\nAxial CT scan obtained 12 months after hospital                         admission shows further resolution of GGO but residual mild bronchiectasis                         and reticular opacity.\n(D)\nGraph of serial pulmonary function                         test results shows gradually improving forced vital capacity (FVC), forced                         expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), and diffusion capacity of the lung for                         carbon monoxide (D\nlco\n), which were still below 80% of predicted                         value at 1 year.\nFigure 2:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nImaging Findings of Chronic Lung Injury after COVID-19 Pneumonia\nLung Parenchymal Abnormalities\nThe pathogenesis of chronic lung injury after COVID-19 is multifactorial and                     represents a combination of direct tissue damage from the viral infection and                     host immune response, lung injury associated with diffuse alveolar damage, and                     barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation (\n6\n).\nTable 2\nsummarizes the                     studies on the long-term radiologic outcomes following hospitalization for                     COVID-19 (\n21\n,\n22\n,\n25\n,\n32\n). The incidence of residual lung                     abnormalities at CT observed at 1-year follow-up ranged from 24% to 54%. No                     clear constellation of findings is typical for PCC. The most frequent CT                     abnormalities at 1 year included ground-glass opacity (GGO), seen in                     8%\u201340% of patients; reticular opacity, seen in 4%\u201339% of patients;                     and traction bronchiectasis or bronchial dilatation, seen in 8%\u201316% of                     patients. Other findings, such as a \u201ccrazy paving\u201d appearance,                     mosaic attenuation, subpleural linear or cystic opacities, and parenchymal                     bands, were also reported. Recently, Han et al (\n22\n) identified lung abnormalities at 2-year follow-up CT in 39% of                     patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia; these abnormalities                     were fibrotic-like (architectural distortion with traction bronchiectasis or                     honeycombing) in 23% of patients and nonfibrotic (GGO or reticular                     abnormalities) in 16%. A limitation of these studies is that most are based on                     hospitalized patients and lack pre-COVID imaging. Thus, some of the described                     abnormalities may represent progression of previously unrecognized lung                     disease.\nTable 2:\nSummary of Studies on Long-term CT Findings of Patients Who Were                             Hospitalized for COVID-19 Pneumonia\nPrevious studies have shown that various radiologic and clinical characteristics                     are associated with long-term residual CT abnormalities (\n21\n,\n22\n,\n25\n,\n32\n\u2013\n34\n). Radiologic                     measures, such as peak CT pneumonia score during hospitalization (\n21\n) and chest radiography score at                     admission (\n25\n), were reported to be                     predictive of long-lasting CT abnormality at 1 year. In addition, clinical                     characteristics, such as older age, severity of acute COVID-19, variant of                     SARS-CoV-2, severity of lung injury in the form of the acute respiratory                     distress syndrome, male sex, high serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and                     lymphopenia, were identified to be predictive of residual 1-year CT                     abnormalities (\n25\n,\n32\n,\n34\n,\n35\n).\nThe CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia gradually improve during longitudinal                     follow-up, even in patients who were critically ill (\n21\n,\n22\n,\n25\n,\n32\n,\n33\n). However, evaluation                     for residual CT abnormalities is warranted, particularly for patients with                     persistent symptoms, because long-lasting lesions can be associated with                     impaired pulmonary functional recovery (\n21\n). Han et al (\n22\n) reported                     that the presence of interstitial abnormality at 2-year follow-up CT, especially                     fibrotic-like abnormality, is associated with abnormal D\nlco\n.                     Considering the association between residual CT abnormalities and pulmonary                     function impairment, surveillance with follow-up CT is important for COVID-19                     survivors. Further evidence is needed to set specific recommendations regarding                     the timelines of these follow-up CT examinations.\nAirway Changes\nThe angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is expressed throughout the airway                     tree and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the virus can directly infect                     and injure the airway and may result in small airways obstruction (\n8\n,\n10\n,\n36\n). Studies evaluating                     paired inspiratory and expiratory CT have shown evidence of a high prevalence of                     small airway disease in patients with prolonged symptoms after COVID-19                     pneumonia. Franquet et al (\n11\n) reported                     that 77% of patients with sustained respiratory symptoms showed air trapping at                     expiratory CT at least 30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. Cho et al (\n10\n) reported that patients with                     long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19 had greater air trapping at expiratory CT                     compared with the healthy controls, regardless of the initial severity of                     infection. The authors hypothesized that the presence of significant air                     trapping reflects persistent bronchiolar inflammation or postviral constrictive                     bronchiolitis as a form of PCC. In a study of 205 patients hospitalized for                     COVID-19 pneumonia (\n9\n), air trapping was                     seen at expiratory CT in 29% of patients at 6-month follow-up, especially in                     patients with severe pneumonia (\nFig 3\n).                     However, these studies lack pre-infection CT scans, making it difficult to                     definitively establish a causal relationship between air trapping and COVID-19                     pneumonia (\n37\n). A comprehensive                     longitudinal investigation is needed to elucidate the temporal changes and                     clinical significance of air trapping in COVID-19 survivors. Although further                     research is needed, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT is still recommended                     for individuals with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 to evaluate for small                     airway disease. Despite the prevalence of post-COVID airways disease, the                     literature provides no guidance for its treatment. Although inhaled                     corticosteroids were found to be potentially effective in resolving                     COVID-related symptoms during the acute phase (\n38\n), no studies have evaluated their use in the post-COVID setting.                     However, if patients have symptoms attributable to radiologic and/or physiologic                     evidence of small airways disease, they are often treated with inhaled                     corticosteroids with or without long-acting \u03b2-agonists. Further studies                     on the clinical significance and management of post-COVID airways disease are                     needed.\nFigure 3:\nChest CT images in a 59-year-old female patient with dyspnea 8 months                             after COVID-19. Representative axial images from\n(A, C)\ninspiratory and\n(B, D)\nexpiratory noncontrast chest CT show                             multifocal areas of low attenuation due to air trapping (arrows in\nB\nand\nD\n), suggestive of postviral                             constrictive bronchiolitis.\nFigure 3:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nBronchial wall thickening (found in 12.5%\u201322.9%), and bronchiectasis                     (found in 19%) are commonly reported in both the acute and chronic stages of                     COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in patients who experienced severe illness (\n11\n,\n39\n,\n40\n). Traction                     bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis at long-term follow-up CT (pathologic                     fibrosis) is most commonly a sequela of COVID-19\u2013related acute                     respiratory distress syndrome but could also represent post-COVID pulmonary                     fibrosis. However, the term \u201ctraction bronchiectasis or                     bronchiolectasis\u201d should be used with caution because bronchial                     dilatation seen in areas of consolidation or GGO in COVID-19 can be completely                     or partially reversible at follow-up CT (\nFig                         2\n) (\n34\n,\n41\n).\nPulmonary Vascular Disease\nPulmonary endothelial injury after COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained by both                     direct viral cytopathic injury and an indirect immune-mediated inflammatory                     response (\n8\n,\n42\n,\n43\n). These                     processes can result in endothelial dysfunction, a continued upregulation of                     coagulation pathways, vasoconstriction, and, eventually, pulmonary vascular                     inflammation and thrombosis (\n12\n,\n44\n). Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major                     vascular abnormality associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and is easily detected                     with conventional contrast-enhanced CT (\n45\n,\n46\n). A meta-analysis that                     included 27 studies with 3342 patients who presented with various levels of                     disease severity suggested that the pooled incidence of PE and deep vein                     thrombosis is as high as 16.5% and 14.8%, respectively, in patients with                     COVID-19 (\n45\n). In addition, dual-energy                     CT has been reported to show abnormal lung perfusion in patients with acute                     COVID but without PE, presumably because of intrapulmonary shunting (\n47\n).\nPulmonary vascular abnormalities and perfusion abnormalities have been reported                     in long-term follow-up studies of patients who had COVID-19 pneumonia. A recent                     investigation (\n13\n) comprising 79 patients                     with persistent COVID-19 symptoms revealed acute PE in 2.5% and chronic PE in 5%                     of cases, as evidenced with dual-energy CT conducted a median of 8 months after                     infection (\nFig 4\n). Furthermore, perfusion                     abnormalities were observed in 87.4% of patients, indicating sustained                     hypercoagulability and microangiopathy (\n13\n) (\nFig 5\n). The Swedish                     national registry data also showed an elevated incidence rate ratio of 1.40 for                     PE in patients at 91\u2013180 days compared with before SARS-CoV-2 infection                         (\n48\n). A study including 44 patients                         (\n49\n) demonstrated that 36% of                     patients had perfusion defects at dual-energy CT at 2\u20133 months after                     SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the presence of perfusion defects was associated with                     significantly higher rates of persistent symptoms, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and                     cough. Microthrombi, resistant to fibrinolysis, have also been detected in blood                     samples from patients with PCC and attributed to thrombus formation (\n50\n). This hypercoagulable status with                     reduced fibrinolytic capacity and resultant microthrombosis in patients with                     COVID-19 may result in vascular tree-in-bud pattern at CT (\n8\n). Another study (\n51\n) demonstrated a decrease in vascular density at sublingual                     videomicroscopy that appeared to exclusively affect small capillaries in                     patients with PCC compared with healthy controls. This decrease in vascular                     density was apparent even 18 months after infection; this may indicate reduction                     of peripheral blood vessels and reduction of pulmonary microcirculation,                     explaining a mechanism for perfusion abnormalities.\nFigure 4:\nCT images show a pulmonary embolus 7 months after COVID-19 pneumonia in                             an 85-year-old woman, who visited the emergency department for                             aggravated dyspnea.\n(A, B)\nCoronal CT images obtained 7                             weeks after symptom onset show ground-glass opacity (GGO) and bronchial                             dilatation at the left upper lobe (dashed circle in\nA\n).\n(C, D)\nCoronal CT images obtained 7 months after the                             infection show improvement of GGO (dashed circle in\nC\n).                             However, a newly developed pulmonary embolus is present in the right                             pulmonary artery (arrow in\nD\n).\nFigure 4:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nFigure 5:\nLung perfusion abnormality in chronic COVID-19 pneumonia in a 51-year-old                             man with mild persistent exertional dyspnea.\n(A, B)\nAxial                             CT images obtained 1 week after symptom onset show diffuse ground-glass                             opacity (GGO) in both lungs peripherally.\n(C, D)\nAxial CT                             images obtained 1 year after COVID-19 show near-complete resolution of                             GGO with residual mild bronchial dilatation and linear opacities.\n(E, F)\nIodine density maps generated from 1-year                             follow-up CT scans (shown in\nC\nand\nD\n)                             demonstrate multifocal perfusion defects (dashed circles).\nFigure 5:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nLung perfusion abnormalities in COVID-19 may consist of a mixture of classic                     segmental defects and less typical distal vessel-related abnormality; such                     lesions could be subtle and easily missed (\n52\n). However, the venous thromboembolism and in situ small-vessel                     pulmonary thromboses in COVID-19 could be a precursor to chronic thromboembolic                     pulmonary hypertension (\n52\n). Although                     these abnormalities may be detected at ventilation perfusion planar scintigraphy                     or SPECT, dual-energy CT has the advantage of simultaneously providing                     morphologic and perfusion information. In a dual-energy CT study of 78 patients                     attending a post-COVID clinic 6 months after infection, the iodine perfusion                     score was correlated with D\nlco\nand with breathlessness (\n53\n). Thus, in patients with persistent                     symptoms, CT pulmonary angiography and dual-energy CT should be considered to                     evaluate for long-term pulmonary vascular sequelae of COVID-19.\nMany different society- and government-sponsored guidelines for the use of                     anticoagulation in COVID-19 have been released. Because of concern over                     excessive venous thromboembolism early in the pandemic, recommendations included                     prophylactic therapeutic- or intermediate-dose heparin in hospitalized patients                         (\n54\n). Subsequent studies have not                     found benefit to this and, although current guidelines vary by society, they                     generally recommend standard-of-care therapy for hospitalized patients (ie,                     prophylactic heparin without contraindication and therapeutic heparin with high                     suspicion of venous thromboembolism) and no standard recommendation for                     prophylactic anticoagulation in outpatients (\n55\n,\n56\n).\nInterpretations and Descriptions of CT Findings at Long-term                     Follow-up\nFor the accurate imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, several structured                     reporting systems have been proposed (\n57\n\u2013\n59\n). However, these                     classification systems are focused on acute COVID-19 findings and lack                     descriptions or terminologies for post\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia. In 2022, a                     glossary of terms, including \u201cpost\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia                     findings,\u201d was proposed by European societies (\n60\n) and included terms such as \u201clow-attenuation                     GGO\u201d and \u201ctinted sign\u201d to describe the resolving status of                     COVID-19 pneumonia. \u201cLow-attenuation GGO\u201d was defined as a                     progressive decrease in attenuation of GGO or consolidation during recovery, and                     \u201ctinted sign\u201d was defined as GGO extending farther into the lungs                     while decreasing in attenuation.\nThe term \u201cpost-COVID fibrosis\u201d has often been used in the                     literature for parenchymal abnormalities such as bronchiolectasis, reticulation,                     parenchymal bands, pleural thickening, and GGOs, but without appropriate                     pathologic confirmation or further follow-up. These findings are more likely to                     occur in patients who had more severe pneumonia at baseline (\n21\n,\n25\n,\n32\n,\n34\n). In the 2022 European glossary, \u201cfibrotic-like                     changes\u201d were defined as reticulations associated with bronchial                     dilatation and distortion in areas of consolidation or GGO. In reporting these                     findings, it should be emphasized that these changes are likely to resolve with                     time (\n32\n) (\nFig 6\n). Similarly, the term \u201cbronchial                     distortion\u201d should be used in preference to \u201ctraction                     bronchiectasis\u201d because of this potential for reversibility (\n41\n). CT findings of multifocal reticular or                     cystic lesions on hospital discharge should be emphasized because these are more                     likely to be associated with persistent abnormality at 1-year follow-up (\n34\n). The CT finding of parenchymal bands is                     unlikely to represent clinically significant fibrosis (\n61\n,\n62\n).\nFigure 6:\nCT images show reversibility of bronchial dilatation and fibrotic-like                             changes in a 65-year-old man with a history of kidney transplant and                             persistent dyspnea.\n(A, B)\nAxial CT images obtained 1 month                             after SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower lobe\u2013predominant mixed                             areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) in bilateral                             lungs. Note the bronchial dilatation (dashed circle) within the mixed                             areas of consolidation and GGO.\n(C, D)\nAxial CT images                             obtained 14 months after infection demonstrate residual low-attenuation                             GGO; however, no residual bronchial dilatation is observed.\nFigure 6:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nEffect of Variants and Vaccines on Chronic Lung Injury after COVID-19\nThe effect of variants, vaccines, and repeat infections on chronic lung injury of                     COVID-19 are still largely unexplored. Because of the accumulation of genetic                     variants over time, distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2 have dominated at different                     stages of the pandemic, with varied transmissibility and pathogenicity. Although                     few direct comparisons have been made, a person\u2019s likelihood of acute and                     chronic lung involvement from COVID-19 seems to depend on the timing of                     infection. The current Omicron variant is less likely to infect the upper and                     lower respiratory tracts (\n63\n) compared                     with its predecessors, the Delta variant (\n64\n) and the Alpha variant (\n65\n), and leads to less severe lung disease, making comparison of                     prevalence studies of post-COVID lung disease challenging. Recent studies have                     also shown that COVID-19 pneumonia is becoming less common and less severe                     because of changes of variants and vaccinations (\n66\n,\n67\n), and these changes may                     lead to fewer residual abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia in the future.\nHistopathologic Characteristics of Persistent Lung Disease after COVID-19\nPost\u2212COVID-19 histopathologic changes of the lungs have been well described.                 The pathologic features of mild and reversible COVID-19 pneumonia include an                 organizing pneumonia pattern, and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by                 diffuse alveolar damage followed by fibrosis or acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia                     (\nFig 7\n). Two previous reports have                 revealed the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage in chronic COVID-19 disease,                 showing a varying degree of fibrosis from early collagen deposition to pronounced                 interstitial collagen deposition (\n14\n,\n15\n). Lung transplant explants 2\u20134 months                 after severe COVID-19 pneumonia have shown diffuse interstitial fibrosis and                 microscopic honeycomb changes without hyaline membrane formation (\n16\n,\n17\n).\nFigure 7:\nImages in a 50-year-old man who underwent lung transplant 45 days after                         initial diagnosis of COVID-19. Explanted lungs showed immature pulmonary                         fibrosis. The patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for more                         than 20 days.\n(A, B)\nAxial CT images obtained 18 days after the                         diagnosis of COVID-19 show patchy and wide areas of ground-glass opacity                         (GGO) and consolidation in bilateral lungs.\n(C, D)\nFollow-up CT                         images obtained 41 days after the diagnosis show diffuse and mixed areas of                         GGO and dense consolidation in both lungs. GGO contains reticulation and                         bronchial dilatation (arrows in\nC\n); air bronchograms                         (arrowheads in\nC\n) and cystic changes (dashed circle in\nD\n) are also noted.\n(E\u2013G)\nLow-magnification photomicrographs (hematoxylin-eosin stain; original                         magnification, \u00d74) of explanted lungs show total collapse of lung                         with early phase of fibrosis and fibroblasts (arrow in\nE\n).                         There are also microscopic honeycomb cysts (arrows in\nF\n) and                         barotrauma cysts (arrows in\nG\n).\nFigure 7:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nRecent studies provide new histopathologic insights for persistent lung disease after                 COVID-19 pneumonia. A study of surgical lung biopsies of 18 patients with persistent                 interstitial lung disease (ILD) following recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia showed                 that 50% of patients had a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern of fibrosis, the                 predominately fibrotic pathologic pattern seen in several chronic ILDs (\n68\n). Some of these patients may have had                 underlying ILDs preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study including 10                 patients who underwent transbronchial lung cryobiopsy an average of 3.5 months after                 recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia reported three different histopathologic clusters.                 Cluster 1 included patients (\nn\n= 2) with CT and histologic evidence                 of fibrosis, thought to have postinfectious progression of preexisting ILD. Cluster                 2 included patients (\nn\n= 5) with CT evidence of organizing                 pneumonia and a range of histologic lung injuries, including organizing pneumonia,                 fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (a predominately inflammatory pattern                 seen in chronic ILD), and diffuse alveolar damage. Cluster 3 included patients                     (\nn\n= 3) with CT findings of relatively mild GGO and histologic                 findings of vascular dilatation and perivascular fibrosis with otherwise normal lung                 parenchyma (\n18\n). This study observed that                 patients in each cluster showed different clinical symptoms and radiologic findings,                 suggesting potentially different underlying pathogenic mechanisms and thus a need                 for the use of differing therapeutic approaches. For instance, all patients from                 three clusters universally showed respiratory symptoms, but patients from cluster 1                 had no systemic symptoms with low D\nlco\n, patients from cluster 2 showed                 systemic symptoms with low D\nlco,\nand those from cluster 3 showed systemic                 symptoms with normal D\nlco\n. Indeed, COVID-19\u2013induced chronic lung                 disease is unlikely to be a single disease entity (\n18\n), and histopathologic correlation with imaging findings can play a                 role in timely diagnosis and optimal management. Alternatively, Diaz et al (\n69\n) reported that patients who underwent                 elective lung resection after complete recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia had no                 discernible histopathologic changes at a median 2-month follow-up, suggesting that                 persistent histopathologic changes may not occur in COVID-19 survivors without                 prolonged symptoms.\nTreatment of Post-COVID Lung Disease\nThere are currently no established treatment guidelines for post-COVID lung disease.                 With the observation early in the pandemic of persistent radiographic abnormalities                 suggestive of organizing pneumonia, corticosteroids were initially reported to speed                 recovery in symptoms, imaging findings, and pulmonary function (\n70\n). Subsequent results from the larger studies                 found potential harm in the use of corticosteroids in hospitalized patients not                 receiving respiratory support (\n71\n,\n72\n) and have led to reluctance to use them in                 outpatients. The currently available antifibrotics, nintedanib and pirfenidone, were                 thought to have a role in the prevention of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis early in                 the pandemic (\n73\n), but only nintedanib is in                 an ongoing clinical trial for the prevention of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis                     (\nclinicaltrials.gov\nno.: NCT04619680). Lung transplant remains a                 viable option for patients with severe post-COVID lung disease, and, although                 short-term outcomes are good, transplant in these complex patients remains                 challenging and requires careful patient selection (\n74\n).\nEmerging Imaging Techniques for Chronic COVID-19 Lung Injury\nTable 3\nsummarizes the emerging imaging                 techniques for evaluating patients with PCC, especially beyond anatomic or                 structural changes. A recently published prospective study by Prayer et al (\n75\n) used ultrahigh-resolution photon-counting                 detector CT to assess the lungs of patients with persisting symptoms after COVID-19                 pneumonia. The study found that photon-counting\u2013detector CT images revealed                 additional subtle lung abnormalities, such as bronchiolectasis and fine                 reticulations, in 10 of 20 participants. These subtle abnormalities were not noted                 on the conventional energy-integrating detector CT scans (\nFig 8\n). This suggests that photon-counting detector CT images                 may enable the precise detection of residual lesions or early-stage fibrosis in                 patients with prolonged symptoms and help identify patients who may require                 additional treatment.\nTable 3:\nSummary of Studies on Emerging Imaging Techniques for Assessing Chronic Lung                         Injury Following COVID-19 Pneumonia\nFigure 8:\nUltrahigh-resolution noncontrast axial CT lung scans in a 55-year-old man                         with persistent exertional dyspnea and chronic fatigue 399 days after                         COVID-19. Four sets of images were obtained:\n(A)\na 1.0-mm image                         obtained with energy-integrating detector CT and\n(B)\n1.0-mm,\n(C)\n0.4-mm, and\n(D)\n0.2-mm images obtained                         with photon-counting detector CT at the same level. Ground-glass opacities                         detected with energy-integrating detector CT (arrows in\nA\n) were                         found to contain reticulations at photon-counting detector CT (arrows in\nB\u2013D\n). Reprinted, with permission, from reference\n75\n.\nFigure 8:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nA novel imaging technique, xenon 129 (\n129\nXe) MRI, also has shown promising                 results in detecting abnormalities of alveolar gas exchange, which are not apparent                 at conventional imaging (\n76\n\u2013\n78\n). In a 2022 study by Grist et al (\n76\n), a reduced mean red blood                 cell\u2013to\u2013tissue plasma ratio was observed at\n129\nXe MRI in                 patients with PCC compared with healthy volunteers, despite normal or near-normal                 appearance of the lung parenchyma at CT (\nFig                     9\n). These findings suggest potential defects in the lung alveolar                 membrane or the surrounding blood vessels resulting in functional impairment beyond                 the structural changes detected at CT. Moreover, Matheson et al (\n78\n) demonstrated abnormal gas exchange at\n129\nXe MR spectroscopy and reduced vascular density metrics at CT in                 patients with PCC, findings that were correlated with impaired D\nlco\nand                 dyspnea. This suggests that microangiopathy may be a pathologic mechanism                 contributing to PCC. In another study that used\n129\nXe MRI to                 prospectively assess 53 patients with PCC, Kooner et al (\n77\n) showed that the percentage of ventilation defects assessed                 with this modality 3 months after COVID-19 were predictive of changes in the                 6-minute walk distance 15 months after COVID-19. These studies elucidate the                 potential of\n129\nXe MRI as a sensitive tool for recognizing and predicting                 clinical outcome of post-COVID fibrosis, as well as comprehending its mechanisms.                 Nonetheless, the number of enrolled patients is limited and, given the relatively                 nonspecific nature of the imaging findings not specific for COVID, further                 investigations are needed to delve into the intricate pathophysiologic aspects of                 post-COVID fibrosis.\nFigure 9:\nExample CT, proton (hydrogen 1 [\n1\nH]), and proton and red blood                         cell\u2013to\u2013tissue plasma (RBC:TP) images in three participants                         with post\u2013COVID-19 condition (PCC).

In 2023,                 Heiss et al (\n79\n) published a study of 54                 pediatric patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were assessed using                 free-breathing phase-resolved pulmonary MRI at low field strength. They showed that                 ventilation-perfusion matching at low-field-strength MRI was reduced in participants                 after COVID-19 infection, including both the recovered group and a group with PCC,                 compared with noninfected healthy controls, up to 1 year after COVID-19 symptom                 onset. Another study (\n80\n) reported several                 parameters reflecting ventilation and perfusion, calculated from low-field-strength                 MRI, that could be used to assess pulmonary functional alterations and showed an                 association between these parameters and persistent symptoms after COVID-19.                 Although the mainstream pulmonary evaluation method in clinical routine is CT, MRI                 has potential advantages as a nonionizing technology capable of providing functional                 information without requiring breath holds or injection of exogenous contrast                 material. One longitudinal study (\n22\n)                 demonstrated that certain patients show persistent respiratory symptoms and impaired                     D\nlco\ndespite normal chest CT scans, and lung MRI may provide additional                 information in this context.\nAdvances in Artificial Intelligence in the Chronic COVID-19 Era\nArtificial intelligence has numerous potential applications in diagnostic imaging,                 including the detection and segmentation of lesions, facilitating diagnosis, guiding                 treatment, and improving prognostication. To date, various deep learning (DL) models                 have been introduced for diagnosis and risk stratification of COVID-19 pneumonia                     (\nTable 4\n).\nTable 4:\nSummary of Studies on Development and Application of Deep Learning Models to                         COVID-19 Pneumonia\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, DL models primarily focused on diagnosing                 COVID-19 using chest radiography or CT. Li et al (\n81\n) developed a DL model with use of nonenhanced chest CT to                 differentiate between COVID-19 pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia or other                 conditions. In that study, the median time from symptom onset to chest CT was 7 days                 (range, 0\u201320 days), and the algorithm achieved high sensitivity and                 specificity (90% and 96%, respectively) for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the                 independent test set. Wang et al (\n82\n)                 developed a DL model that can be used to triage febrile patients as having either                 COVID-19 pneumonia or another condition. They validated its performance in a large                 external validation set of 2120 patients, achieving an area under the receiver                 operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.953 for detecting COVID-19 among febrile                 patients. Furthermore, the model reduced the time to diagnosis compared with                 radiologists, which is crucial during a pandemic.\nDL models have also been developed for prognostication and risk stratification of                 COVID-19 pneumonia. Wang et al (\n83\n) developed                 a DL system to stratify patients with COVID-19 into high- and low-risk groups based                 on chest CT scans from 709 patients. They demonstrated that hospital-stay time                 differed significantly between the two groups in two external validation sets. In                 another study, Wang et al (\n84\n) developed a DL                 model that integrated CT findings and clinical data of 1051 patients with COVID-19                 to predict the length of time from hospital admission to critical illness. This                 model showed promising performance for predicting disease progression, with an AUC                 of 0.804. Similarly, Lassau et al (\n85\n)                 integrated CT data with five clinical and biologic variables (age, sex, oxygenation,                 serum urea level, and platelet count) and constructed a DL model using data from 646                 patients with COVID-19. The model showed an AUC of 0.790 for predicting critically                 ill COVID-19 condition, such as the need for ventilation, high oxygen, or death.\nArtificial intelligence also has a wide range of clinical applications in PCC. One                 study (\n86\n) created a DL model from the                 electronic health records of more than 1.7 million patients, using various baseline                 clinical parameters, such as demographic characteristics, health care utilization,                 diagnosis, and medication, to identify potential PCC among patients with COVID-19.                 The model yielded strong performance for identifying patients with COVID-19 who                 would go on to develop PCC, achieving AUCs of 0.92 for all patients, 0.90 for                 hospitalized patients, and 0.85 for nonhospitalized patients (\n86\n). In another study (\n87\n), researchers developed an algorithm to classify patients with PCC                 (30\u2013180 days after infection) into four clinical subphenotypes:\n(a)\ncardiac and renal symptoms;\n(b)\nrespiratory, sleep, and anxiety symptoms;\n(c)\nmusculoskeletal and                 nervous system symptoms; and\n(d)\ndigestive and respiratory system                 sequelae. These were highly reproducible across two cohorts with distinct patient                 populations and geographical characteristics. This algorithm could potentially be                 used to guide optimal management for patients with PCC. In terms of radiologic                 features, Zhou et al (\n88\n) developed a DL                 model to optimize CT image window and level to identify subtle CT features of                 chronic COVID-19 lung injury that are either invisible or subtle with standard                 display settings. With the aid of a DL model, radiologists may find                 symptom-correlated interpretable but subtle CT features from patients with COVID-19                     (\n88\n).\nWith the increasing number of COVID-19 survivors, automated segmentation and                 quantification of CT findings for those with persistent symptoms after COVID-19                 pneumonia will be extremely useful. Although we lack image analysis software                 specifically developed for chronic CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia, there are                 various commercially available DL-based segmentation tools for ILD and small airway                 disease (\n89\n\u2013\n91\n). Adopting predeveloped artificial intelligence software for                 the evaluation of chronic lung disease after COVID-19 may enable more objective and                 quantitative interpretation of the CT features, including GGO, reticulation,                 bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolectasis, honeycombing, and air trapping (\nFig 10\n). Taken together, the growing body of                 literature suggests that the development and implementation of artificial                 intelligence\u2013powered technologies may enhance daily clinical practice and                 allow for effective workflow in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFigure 10:\nImages demonstrate application of a deep-learning (DL) model for automatic                         segmentation and quantification of chronic lung parenchymal changes after                         COVID-19 pneumonia (aview Lung Texture; Coreline Soft). A 64-year-old man                         underwent chest CT for the evaluation of pulmonary sequela 12 months after                         SARS-CoV-2 infection. He had no relevant symptoms.\n(A, C)\nAxial                         CT images show focal areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and reticulation in                         bilateral lungs.\n(B, D)\nApplication of DL model developed for                         the segmentation and quantification of interstitial lung abnormality shows                         automatic segmentation and quantification of reticular opacity (orange, 2%                         of total lung volume) and GGO (yellow, 1% of total lung volume).\nFigure 10:\nDownload as PowerPoint\nConclusion\nA comprehensive understanding of the clinical, histologic, and radiologic aspects of                 the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 is crucial. Imaging plays a critical role in the                 evaluation and management of these patients. Studies have indicated that a subset of                 patients continue to exhibit residual CT abnormalities, including ground-glass                 opacity, reticulation, and bronchiectasis, even 1 year after COVID-19 symptom onset.                 Furthermore, these abnormalities have been correlated with lung function impairment.                 The presence of chronic pulmonary embolism on pulmonary CT angiograms or perfusion                 abnormalities on dual-energy CT scans have also been observed and in some                 individuals may indicate a thrombogenic or microangiopathic response to SARS-CoV-2                 infection.\nMany factors can influence post\u2013COVID-19 condition (PCC), such as diverse                 COVID-19 variants, breakthrough and recurrent infections, co-infections,                 patients\u2019 immune status, and vaccinations, all of which must be considered as                 we move forward (\n92\n). For instance, many                 predictive and risk stratification models based on DL have been developed for                 patients with PCC, and it is essential to validate their performance in various                 environments. In addition, novel imaging techniques can reveal chronic pathologic                 changes beyond an anatomic resolution. Imaging modalities, such as photon-counting                 detector CT,\n129\nXe MRI, and low-field-strength MRI, have been used to                 detect subtle lung parenchymal abnormalities or functional impairment that                 conventional CT may not capture. However, the clinical application of these emerging                 techniques is still limited, and their diagnostic and prognostic performance must be                 further verified. Future studies will improve understanding of the long-term                 clinical, histologic, and radiologic effects of PCC decades after the initial                 infection.\nDisclosures of conflicts of interest:\nM.J.C.\nNo relevant relationships.\nJ.J.S.\nGrants                         from Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, and National Institutes of Health;                         consulting fees from Istesso; payment or honoraria for lectures,                         presentations, speakers bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events                         from Bohringer Ingelheim; payment for expert testimony from Cooper, Rice and                         Olson, Childs McCune, and Burg Simpson; support for attending meetings                         and/or travel from Boehringer Ingelheim; participation on a data safety                         monitoring board or advisory board at University of Pittsburgh.\nJ.E.L.\nNo relevant relationships.\nH.C.\nNo                         relevant relationships.\nK.J.C.\nNo relevant relationships.\nK.S.L.\nNo relevant relationships.\nD.A.L.\nFees                         to institution for consultancy from Daiichi Sankyo, Astra Zeneca, and                         Calyx.\nAcknowledgments\nWe express our sincere gratitude to Yeon Joo Jeong, MD, PhD, and Tom\u00e1s                     Franquet, MD, PhD, for reviewing and providing pathology images.\nArticle History\nReceived: June 27 2023\nRevision requested: July 31 2023\nRevision received: Sept 6 2023\nAccepted: Sept 26 2023\nPublished online: Jan 09 2024\nFigures\nReferences\nRelated\nDetails\nReferences\n1.\nThompson EJ\n,\nWilliams DM\n,\nWalker AJ\n,\net                             al\n;\nOpenSAFELY Collaborative\n.\nLong COVID                         burden and risk factors in 10 UK longitudinal studies and electronic health                         records\n.\nNat                         Commun\n2022\n;13(1):3528.\nMedline\nGoogle Scholar\n2.\nTsampasian V\n,\nElghazaly H\n,\nChattopadhyay R\n,\net                             al\n.\nRisk factors associated                         with post-COVID-19 condition: a systematic review and                         meta-analysis\n.\nJAMA Intern                         Med\n2023\n;183(6):566\u2013580.\nMedline\nGoogle Scholar\n3.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n.\nLong COVID or                         post-COVID Conditions\n.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html\n.

The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions.\nMethods:\nVolunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.\nResults:\nThe community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.\nConclusions:\nTransmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane. This will impact an institution\u2019s mitigation needs. Operating procedures should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed. The suggestions provided are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors or the American Thoracic Society.\nKeywords\n:\nCOVID-19\n;\nSARS-CoV-2\n;\npulmonary function tests\n;\nbronchoscopy\n;\npolysomnography\n... Show All\nIn March 2020, many elective medical services were canceled in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) were undertaken across the United States in an effort to reduce the number of cases and deaths and to prevent healthcare resources from being overwhelmed. By late April 2020, the daily COVID-19 case rate was declining in many states.\nThe Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors (APCCSDD) discussed operational aspects of COVID-19 clinical care during a weekly webinar hosted by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) throughout the pandemic. Participants foresaw the need for guidance in resuming on-site activities for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions, and it was decided that a plan would be created on the basis of consensus. The plan is guided by the realization that as community physical-distancing practices are loosened, there is a risk of virus reintroduction; therefore, ambulatory clinics must make significant efforts to mitigate the risk of viral exposure to patients and to staff until the threat of COVID-19 has receded.\nThe goals of the plan are to\n1\n) protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus;\n2\n) account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19; and\n3\n) provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. The suggestions in this document should not be considered mandates. They are intended as a baseline from which institutions can develop their own plan, consistent with their unique circumstances. The suggestions are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the APCCSDD or the ATS.\nMethods\nSection:\nChoose\nTop of page\nAbstract\nMethods <<\nResuming Outpatient Clini...\nSpecific Pulmonary and Sl...\nConclusions\nReferences\nCITING ARTICLES\nThe ATS Chief of Guidelines and Documents solicited volunteers from the APCCSDD to serve as group leaders and create plans for restoring normal operations in outpatient pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography (PSG) laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) facilities. Each group leader formed a working group to assist in creation of the plans. Completed plans from the individual working groups were collated into an overall plan and document. The draft was shared with all authors, who reviewed the document and provided feedback and edits. Several cycles of review and revision ensued until there was consensus that submission for peer review was warranted. The manuscript was revised to address peer-reviewer comments and then underwent several cycles of review and revision before being submitted for further consideration by the\nJournal\n.\nResuming Outpatient Clinical Services\nSection:\nChoose\nTop of page\nAbstract\nMethods\nResuming Outpatient Clini... <<\nSpecific Pulmonary and Sl...\nConclusions\nReferences\nCITING ARTICLES\nWhen to Resume\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recommend that the resumption of elective in-person services be considered only in states or regions that have satisfied the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gating criteria for reopening:\n1\n) a downward trajectory of COVID-19\u2013like cases and influenza-like illnesses over a 14-day period,\n2\n) hospitals having capability to treat all patients without crisis care,\n3\n) a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, and\n4\n) a downward trajectory of confirmed cases over a 14-day period or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percentage of total tests over a 14-day period (\n1\n,\n2\n). The recommendation for a downward trajectory of confirmed cases assumes that the volume of testing remains relatively constant; otherwise, variation in the daily case rate may reflect changes in testing volume rather than the infection rate. For this reason, it is important that an adequate volume of testing be achieved before determining the 14-day trajectory of the case rate, as increasing the testing volume while using the case rate for decision-making may be misleading.\nIt can be difficult to determine the trajectory of the case rate over 14 days if there is large day-to-day variation. In this situation, alternative approaches include\n1\n) calculating the mean case rate over the previous 7 days and using a decrease in this measure for 14 consecutive days as indicative of a downward trajectory of the case rate or\n2\n) using the COVID-19 hospital admission rate as a surrogate for the case rate (\nFigure 1\n). The latter has the added advantage of being less dependent on testing volume. For communities in which the case rate is already low, 14 consecutive days with a consistently low case rate is sufficient to resume elective in-person clinical visits, as long as the case rate is not trending upward.\nFigure 1.\nAssessment of the local new case rate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend a downward trajectory in the new case rate for 14 days before resuming elective medical services. (\nA\n) The trajectory of the new case rate can be variable from day-to-day. (\nB\n) Using the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization rate as a surrogate provides less day-to-day variability and is less dependent on testing volume. (\nC\n) The mean new case rate over the preceding 7 days (red line) also provides less day-to-day variability.\nDownload Figure\n|\nDownload Powerpoint\n[More]\n[Minimize]\nIn addition to a downward trajectory or consistently low case rate, to resume elective clinical services, an institution should have the capacity to implement all of the operational strategies described below: patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance.\nPatient Prioritization\nSafely restoring outpatient pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinical services requires the prioritization of patients\u2019 needs. During the period in which elective medical services were cancelled or reduced, many patients did not receive usual care, and a backlog developed; ideally, the resumption of in-person visits should be prioritized for the patients who need them most. The CMS Non-Emergent, Elective Medical Services, and Treatment Recommendations classify ambulatory services into tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 on the basis of the acuity and urgency of the requested services (\n3\n). Tier 1 visits involve low-acuity services for routine specialty care, screening, preventive care, or supervised rehabilitative-therapy services. Tier 2 visits involve intermediate acuity services for established patients with new symptoms or for new patients with nonurgent symptoms. Tier 3 high-acuity services are for new patients with new symptoms or for any patient with severe symptoms (\nFigure 2\n).\nFigure 2.\nFramework for the prioritization of elective medical services on the basis of acuity. COVID-19\u2009=\u2009coronavirus disease 2019.\nDownload Figure\n|\nDownload Powerpoint\n[More]\n[Minimize]\nThis framework prioritizes outpatient services on the basis of acuity and can be tailored to institutional resources, patient and provider preferences, and community disease prevalence:\n\u2022\nInstitutional resources.\nPertinent institutional resources include space, staff, and personal protective equipment (PPE). If any of these resources are in short supply, an institution may choose to resume services with fewer in-person visits than if those resources were abundant. As an example, an institution may decide to open at half-capacity because of a shortage of PPE and, therefore, may accommodate only tier 3 patients, whereas it might have opened to both tier 2 and tier 3 patients had there not been a shortage of PPE.\n\u2022\nProvider and patient preferences.\nTier 2 visits in the CMS framework incorporate provider and patient discretion. For example, providers who routinely see highly specialized pulmonary or sleep problems may be comfortable with video visits in situations in which another provider less familiar with the subspecialty problem may wish to see patients in person. Factors that may influence patient preferences include access to and familiarity with telehealth resources, balanced against the burden and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure associated with in-person visits.\n\u2022\nCommunity disease prevalence.\nIn regions with a low prevalence of COVID-19, less restrictive mitigation strategies may be appropriate. For example, tier 2 patients can be accommodated by either telehealth or in-person visits; in the context of high disease prevalence, a telehealth appointment may be preferable, whereas in the context of low disease prevalence, an in-person visit may be preferable.\nScreening and Testing for SARS-CoV-2\nIdentification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and removal of such patients from the normal flow of patient care as early as possible are essential components of an effective strategy to resume clinical operations and ensure the safety of other patients and staff.\nAll patients scheduled for outpatient services should undergo screening for high-risk exposures, fever, and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (i.e., cough, dyspnea, myalgias, anosmia, and/or dysgeusia) (\n4\n). This will ideally be done in two phases. The first phase of screening should ideally occur within 72 hours of the scheduled appointment, and no more than 7 days before the scheduled appointment, by reaching out to patients by telephone or e-mail or providing access to online check-in and screening. During the screening, patients should also be advised on institutional policies for people accompanying them to their clinic appointment, and anyone accompanying them should also be screened. Patients who are detected by screening as having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing, ideally within 48 hours of the scheduled visit. Testing is particularly important in patients with pulmonary disease because many patients have chronic and/or acute symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from COVID-19.\nThe second phase of screening should occur upon arrival for their appointment (or they should undergo initial screening if they could not be reached for advanced screening) and, like the first phase, should consist of questioning about exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, fever, and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Temperature checks upon arrival are appropriate if resources permit. Facilities should take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission by using separate spaces or buildings for care of patients with acute COVID-19 and by implementing mitigation procedures in areas used for non\u2013COVID-19 patient care. On the basis of the results of screening plus testing, the following approaches are recommended:\n\u2022\nNo symptoms during initial screening and upon arrival, or SARS-CoV-2-negative test and no symptoms upon arrival.\nThe patient may proceed to an area dedicated for low-risk patients to wait for their appointment.\n\u2022\nSARS-CoV-2 negative test results but new symptoms upon arrival or SARS-CoV-2 status unknown (never tested) but new symptoms upon arrival.\nThe patient should be directed to a dedicated waiting area for high-risk patients, where they can undergo diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, or they should be sent home to quarantine until testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed. If the test results for SARS-CoV-2 are negative and concern for COVID-19 persists (i.e., an alternative cause of symptoms has not been identified), a second test may be performed to minimize the chance of being misled by an initial false-negative result.\n\u2022\nSARS-CoV-2\u2013positive test result.\nIf appropriate, the patient should be sent home to quarantine and should contact their primary care provider regarding next steps. Their appointment may be done by telehealth while in quarantine or rescheduled to a later date. SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive patients with acute symptoms requiring urgent evaluation should be masked and accompanied to the closest emergency department or urgent-care COVID-19 evaluation unit by personnel wearing PPE.\nThe decision about when to reschedule patients with COVID-19 for elective in-person visits may be extrapolated from the CDC\u2019s guidance on when infected healthcare workers may return to work (\n5\n). Patients identified as having COVID-19 may be rescheduled for elective in-person clinical services when one of the following three situations exists:\n1\n) they lack fever (i.e., temperature\u2009<\u2009100\u00b0F) without fever-reducing medications, their respiratory symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnea) have improved, and they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart;\n2\n) they have been free from fever without fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours, their symptoms have improved, and at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their symptoms first appeared; or\n3\n) if asymptomatic, they have either tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart or at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The requirement for two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart is intended to minimize false-negative test results. The alternative requirement of 10 days from a positive test result or the onset of symptoms is based on limited evidence about the duration that viable virus is shed (\n6\n).\nPhysical Distancing\nPhysical distancing will remain a key approach to minimizing the recurrence of viral transmission as healthcare centers reopen, so institutions should employ strategies that facilitate physical distancing. There are numerous distancing strategies, and the higher the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, the more strategies will be warranted. Nonpatient visitors may be restricted or prohibited. Patients may be asked to wait outside until contacted on their cell phone to come into the clinic. Fewer patients may be scheduled per day and their appointments may be spaced out to minimize the density of people in the buildings, waiting areas, and clinical areas. Waiting areas may be reconfigured to ensure that there is a minimum of 6 feet between patients (does not require physical separation between a patient and an individual accompanying the patient). Limits may be placed on the number of individuals allowed in an elevator. Patients who are able may be encouraged to use stairs instead of an elevator. Unidirectional patient flow may be designed (check in at one point, go to clinic room, then check out at another point). Similarly, hallways and stairwells may be designated for unidirectional flow.\nInfection Control and PPE\nPatients who are not wearing a surgical mask or suitable face covering when they arrive should be provided a surgical mask and asked to don the mask upon entry into the building. Examination rooms should be cleaned between patients. Only essential medical contact should occur (i.e., between the provider and the patient only). Other communication, such as scheduling follow-up appointments and tests, should be done electronically, either at the time of the visit or via subsequent telephone or e-mail contact with the patient.\nHealthcare workers should wear a surgical mask throughout the medical facility for the entire duration of their shift. Additional protective equipment should be worn when interacting with patients, with the specific PPE depending on the risk of aerosolization. For example, healthcare workers may wear surgical masks while interviewing patients and then upgrade to surgical masks, gloves, and gowns during physical examinations, with face shields added for cough maneuvers and examinations of the nose and mouth. Vigilant PPE practices should be maintained for an extended duration, given the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19.\nFollow-Up Surveillance\nThe patient should be instructed to contact the clinic if they develop new respiratory symptoms within 14 days of their visit and/or if COVID-19 is diagnosed. If human resources permit, institutions should reach out to patients roughly 2 weeks after their clinical service and assess if they remain symptom free, have developed symptoms of COVID-19, have undergone SARS-CoV-2 testing, and, if they have been tested, whether the results were positive or negative. Patients reporting new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who have not been tested should be instructed to quarantine and should be referred for diagnostic testing. Those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to the local health department for contact tracing if such public health services are available. For those who test negative, if concern for COVID-19 remains (i.e., symptoms cannot be attributed to another cause), repeat testing may be performed \u226524 hours later to minimize the risk of false-negative results.\nAssessment of Operational Success\nThe success, or lack thereof, of resuming pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinical services should be critically appraised periodically. Operational success can be defined as the absence of viral transmission, ability to handle the patient volume without exceeding social-distancing constraints, and lack of delays in patient flow resulting in bottlenecks. Assessment should be iterative, with the goal of gradually increasing the percentage of in-person visits.\nIf surveillance finds no viral transmission within the institution and the community daily case rate remains low, clinical services may be increased; however, if surveillance reveals viral transmission within the institution or the community daily case rate has increased, operating procedures should be reassessed. Before closing elective in-person clinical services, operations decision-makers should consider the potential adverse consequences of reclosure on patients and whether additional mitigation procedures are possible.\nStaff Considerations\nStaff should receive either COVID-19 or non\u2013COVID-19 assignments and should not rotate through both clinical settings. They should be trained on the appropriate PPE for various tasks. Staff should also be screened for symptoms daily, and those who develop symptoms should be sent home, quarantined, and tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nFor staff with confirmed COVID-19, a test-based strategy may be used to determine when they can return to work if sufficient resources exist; otherwise, a non\u2013test-based strategy should be followed. If a test-based strategy is used, staff may return to work once they lack fever (i.e., temperature\u2009<\u2009100\u00b0F) without fever-reducing medications, have improvement of their symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnea), and test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart. Staff who are asymptomatic may return once they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart (\n5\n). If a non\u2013test-based strategy is used, staff may return to work once they have been free from fever without fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours, they have improvement of their symptoms, and at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their symptoms first appeared. Staff who are asymptomatic should wait at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) from their first test positive for SARS-CoV-2 before returning to work (\n5\n).\nThe choice between a test-based strategy and a non\u2013test-based strategy depends on institutional resources and preferences, as neither strategy is infallible. Testing may yield false-negative results, providing false reassurance and allowing an infectious healthcare worker to return to work. It may also detect prolonged shedding of inactive (rather than active) viral particles, delaying the healthcare worker\u2019s return to work. A non\u2013test-based strategy relies on scarce, early data regarding the duration of shedding of viable virus that has not been rigorously confirmed. Reports of outbreaks after the return of symptomatically recovered patients with COVID-19 to their living facilities suggest that a cautious approach is prudent (i.e., testing for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected \u226524 hours apart to minimize false-negative results), especially for healthcare workers in high-risk settings like nursing homes and healthcare workers who care for patients who are immunocompromised. Because information about the relationship between testing results and infectivity risk is evolving, institutional guidance may change and should be followed.\nSpecific Pulmonary and Sleep-Medicine Services\nSection:\nChoose\nTop of page\nAbstract\nMethods\nResuming Outpatient Clini...\nSpecific Pulmonary and Sl... <<\nConclusions\nReferences\nCITING ARTICLES\nPulmonary Function Testing\nPFT presents unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. PFTs may result in high aerosol generation, which can spread droplets from an infected individual even if they are asymptomatic. Cross-contamination of equipment, testing rooms, waiting areas, and corridors may result in viral transmission to staff and other patients, which is particularly problematic for vulnerable patients. Therefore, some institutions may prefer a strategy of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients who are scheduled to undergo PFTs within 72 hours of their appointment, in contrast to the approach described above, in which patients are tested for SARS-CoV-2 if they are found during screening to have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The final strategy depends on institutional preferences, resources, and local prevalence.\nIt is important to be mindful of the risks versus benefits for every patient scheduled to undergo PFTs and for every procedure. In other words, how important is the lung-function test for making a diagnosis and/or decision relative to the risk of exposing staff and cross-contaminating equipment? Examples of situations that might favor performing PFTs include the evaluation of lung-transplant and lung-resection candidacy, assessment of the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung or bone-marrow transplant recipients, diagnostic evaluation of patients with significant unexplained or complex dyspnea, and guidance of clinical decisions in patients with chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease.\nOnce it has been determined that PFTs are indicated, the specific test must be considered because tests have varying risk of aerosolization and viral transmission (e.g., methacholine-challenge testing, exercise-challenge testing, and cardiopulmonary-exercise testing are higher risk than spirometry, 6-minute walk test, and measurement of lung volumes or diffusion capacity). Only tests deemed essential should be performed. In most situations, this will include spirometry with or without diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. If bronchodilator testing must be performed, use of a metered dose inhaler is preferable to a nebulizer to minimize aerosol exposure. If a nebulizer must be used, a breath-actuated nebulizer is likely lower risk than a regular nebulizer. A viral/bacterial filter can be attached to the side of some nebulizers to capture the exhaled aerosol particles and limit the amount of potentially infectious aerosol that enters the room during the treatment. It is less common that lung volumes will be essential, but use of body plethysmography units might be preferable because of containment of exhaled air. Exercise testing and bronchial-challenge procedures should be postponed if possible because of their particularly high risk of high aerosol production due to high minute ventilation or coughing. For patients who need ongoing surveillance of pulmonary function, home spirometry is a reasonable option with enhanced coaching and education by video and telemedicine. However, clinicians should be aware that the results from home spirometry may be less reliable because of quality issues.\nDuring the PFTs, appropriate precautions must be followed. For high-risk patients (e.g., those from a high-prevalence community) or high-risk aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., bronchial-challenge testing), the PFTs should be performed in a negative-pressure room, if available and as per local policy. Patients should be instructed in cough etiquette and wear a surgical mask as much as possible to avoid aerosol dispersion, and the staff should wear appropriate PPE (N95 mask, face shield, gown, and gloves). Both patients and staff should maintain a safe distance from one another and wash their hands before and after testing.\nOnly necessary PFT equipment should be kept within the laboratory. In-line antibacterial and antiviral filters should be used, and equipment should be disinfected according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The room should be disinfected between patients, and physical distancing should be practiced in common areas (\n7\n). Sufficient time should be allotted between patients to allow adequate room ventilation; the exact amount of time will vary depending on whether the room is under negative pressure and whether there is concomitant use of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or ultraviolet-light decontamination (\n8\n). The same precautions should be taken if the PFTs are performed in the context of research.\nBronchoscopy and Procedure Suites\nWhen an institution is ready to resume outpatient clinical activities, the backlog that developed during the suspension of elective services should be addressed by prioritizing the procedures according to urgency.\nA priori\nty scoring system (the Medically Necessary and Time-Sensitive instrument) was developed to assist with the prioritization of procedures (\n9\n). An example of a high-priority elective procedure is a lung mass with lymphadenopathy for diagnosis and staging, whereas a lower-priority elective procedure is surveillance of a stent or transplant or surveillance of tracheostomy changes (\n10\n).\nThere is no empirical evidence regarding the necessity of preprocedural testing for SARS-CoV-2. Many institutions perform preprocedural testing on all patients because of the high prevalence of asymptotic COVID-19 infections coupled with the high risk of viral transmission due to aerosolization during bronchoscopy and similar procedures. Any patient who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 and does not have an urgent need for the procedure should have their procedure deferred. The procedure should not be rescheduled until the patient meets one of the three criteria described above for rescheduling elective in-person clinical services.\nThe procedure schedule should allot more time per patient than usual, so there are fewer patients and staff in the suite at any given time. In the waiting, preprocedural, and recovery areas, patients and staff should wear surgical masks, and physical distancing should be respected.\nBronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy are superspreading procedures that confer a particularly high risk of viral transmission. Such procedures should be performed in a negative-pressure room. The minimal number of necessary providers should participate in a procedure, and they should be vigilant in donning and doffing PPE, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown, gloves, hat, and shoe covers. Patients should ideally recover in a negative-pressure room. Lower-risk procedures, such as pleural procedures, may be performed outside of a negative-pressure environment if a HEPA filter is available. Staff should wear a surgical mask, face shield, gown, and gloves.\nOnly necessary testing equipment should be kept within the procedure suite. Cleaning and decontamination should be done between procedures. This includes a standard disinfection protocol for durable, reusable video monitors and standard high-level disinfection of reusable bronchoscopes (\n11\n).\nPatients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive and must have a procedure performed should have their procedure performed at the end of the workday so that the room may be terminally cleaned after the procedure. Full PPE should be used, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown, gloves, head covering, and shoe covers.\nPSG Laboratories\nPSG services should resume in a phased manner to allow for staff acclimation to new workflows. The first phase should involve home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) as a preferred diagnostic test for obstructive sleep apnea (this can also be deployed during an ongoing COVID-19 emergency if resources are available). Mail delivery of devices to and from the patient\u2019s home is encouraged. Use of disposable HSAT equipment, if available, can also be considered. Upon receipt by mail, the bagged device should be isolated for 72 hours and then cleaned and disinfected with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered product recommended by the manufacturer (\n12\n,\n13\n). Concurrent initiation of in-laboratory PSG overnight testing might be considered by some laboratories where the prevalence of COVID-19 remains low and staff are appropriately trained and comfortable with local infection-control policies.\nThe next phase is the initiation of in-laboratory diagnostic PSG without positive-airway-pressure (PAP) titration. Testing should begin at 50% capacity to facilitate physical distancing between technologists in the control room and allow for acclimation to the new workflows and increased use of PPE. This service could be ramped up as these concerns are adequately overcome.\nPatients who are at high risk for adverse outcomes should be prioritized. This includes patients with significant sleepiness (e.g., due to narcolepsy), safety concerns (e.g., rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder), or comorbid conditions that raise concerns for central sleep apnea and/or hypoventilation syndromes (e.g., congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, morbid obesity), which should be assessed by attended PSG. For each patient, the benefits of in-laboratory testing should be weighed against the potential risk of developing COVID-19\u2013related illness (e.g., for older adults, pregnant women, and those with serious medical conditions) before deciding on in-laboratory PSG (\n14\n). The multiple-sleep-latency test/maintenance-of-wakefulness test should follow guidelines similar to those for in-laboratory PSG. Mattresses should have plastic covers that can be cleaned and disinfected with an EPA-registered disinfectant (\n12\n,\n13\n). All room surfaces should also be cleaned and disinfected between patients, and the same disinfectants should be used (\n15\n).\nChildren are more likely to have asymptomatic cases; therefore, testing for SARS-CoV-2 48 hours before the sleep study should be considered in high-prevalence areas. Use of PPE by staff conducting pediatric testing should be strongly considered. Because most pediatric and even some adult sleep studies require a family member to stay overnight, any family member that comes to the sleep center should undergo similar testing for COVID-19 before being allowed to stay at the sleep center, and if they test negative, they may stay in the room with the patient.\nThe final phase of restoring sleep services consists of the strategic introduction of PAP titrations, which are associated with an increased aerosolization risk. During PAP titration, the technologist should wear appropriate PPE equipment (N95 mask, face shield, gown, and gloves) and should be assigned one patient per night to mitigate risk of transmission. Portable HEPA filter units in the rooms should also be considered. If available, use of nonvented masks with a disposable expiratory port and attached HEPA filter may further reduce the risk of aerosolization (\n16\n). If PAP titrations cannot be performed, patients can be initiated on automatic continuous PAP (auto-CPAP) units on the basis of HSAT or PSG results and followed closely with remote monitoring of PAP data. Alternatively, during the COVID-19 public emergency, patients can be initiated on auto-PAP without a diagnostic sleep study, on the basis of clinician judgment and payer coverage policies.\nPulmonary Rehabilitation\nPR is standard care for patients with chronic respiratory disease and continued symptoms and/or functional limitations despite otherwise maximal medical therapy. It is typically delivered as a group program with shared exercise equipment and group learning. This format has not been feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infection-control policies. Home PR alternatives to center-based PR have not been extensively studied, but several remotely delivered PR models are available with some published evidence of their efficacy (\n17\n\u2013\n19\n). If remote PR is used, it should deliver the essential components of PR, which include exercise training, education, and behavior change.\nThere appears to be a great need for rehabilitative services for those with post\u2013COVID-19 cardiopulmonary impairment and musculoskeletal compromise after critical illness. In this population, consideration should be given to acute rehabilitation during hospitalization once patients are hemodynamically stable and within the context of infectious-control policies and protocols. Routine rehabilitative services in COVID-19 survivors should be considered when patients are no longer contagious to address any unmet rehabilitation needs.\nAssessment should include measurements of physiological limitations (e.g., lung function, exercise and functional capacity, muscle function, balance) as well as patient-centered outcomes (e.g., symptoms and health-related quality of life). Collection of data regarding the outcomes of rehabilitative interventions will be necessary to inform future decision-making regarding rehabilitative interventions for survivors of COVID-19.\nFrom a logistical standpoint, before each PR session, patients should undergo the same screening and SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy described above for elective in-person services. Throughout each session, healthcare workers and patients should maintain social distancing. A surgical mask should be worn during the educational and behavioral-change portions of the session, and healthcare workers should change to an N95 mask, gloves, and gown during the exercise-training portion because of the risk of aerosolization during exercise. Only necessary equipment with adequate spacing should be kept in the training area, which should be thoroughly decontaminated after each session.\nConclusions\nSection:\nChoose\nTop of page\nAbstract\nMethods\nResuming Outpatient Clini...\nSpecific Pulmonary and Sl...\nConclusions <<\nReferences\nCITING ARTICLES\nElective medical services were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation strategies, such as physical distancing, were undertaken to reduce the number of cases and deaths and to prevent healthcare resources from being overwhelmed. The suspension of elective clinical services cannot be indefinite because patients\u2019 health needs must be addressed. The CDC and CMS both indicate the resumption of clinical services can be considered once there is a 14-day downward trajectory of new cases, assuming that institutions have an operational strategy for the mitigation of viral transmission within the healthcare facility. Such a plan should consist of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. Importantly, a static plan is unlikely to remain maximally effective in the context of a dynamic process like SARS-CoV-2 transmission; therefore, the operational strategy should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed to emphasize strengths and correct faults.\nAcknowledgment\nMembers of the task force are as follows:\nCoordination\nKevin C.
