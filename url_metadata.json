This study aimed to evaluate the relation between clinical practice and the outcomes of patients admitted for COPD exacerbations in Portuguese hospitals. Materials and Methods Observational, multicentre, prospective study with a 60-days follow-up period, in 11 hospitals, including patients aged 30 years, admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, smoking habits, hospitalisations, pulmonary function, comorbidities, COPD symptoms, and treatment. Sixty days after discharge, COPD exacerbations management, outcome measures, and readmission data were evaluated through a structured phone follow-up interview. Results 196 patients were included (85.7% male, mean age 71.2 years), the majority admitted through the emergency service. Ex-smokers and current smokers accounted for 51% and 36%, respectively. On admission, 72.4% were on LAMA, 54.6% on LABA, and 45.5% were on LABA/LAMA. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were used in 37.3% and systemic steroids (SCS) in 10.3%. 35.7 % had had at least one exacerbation, with hospitalisation, in the previous year. There was no spirometry data for 23.2%. On hospitalisation, 98.5% of patients were treated with oxygen and 38.3% with non-invasive ventilation. Additionally, 93.4% used SCS and 60.2% ICS. Antibiotics were administered to 85.2%. 95.4% of patients were discharged; 9 died, 5 of whom had a COPD-related death. The median length of stay was 12 days for discharged patients and 33 days for patients who died. At discharge, 79.1% were prescribed with LAMA, 63.6% SCS, 61.5% LABA and 55.6% LAMA+LABA. 26,2% were prescribed with ICS+LABA+LAMA. At follow-up, 44.4% had a scheduled medical appointment within the 60 days after being discharged, and 28.3% were later readmitted due to exacerbation, of whom 52.8% were hospitalised. Conclusions The severity of COPD, particularly in exacerbations, is directly related to impaired lung function and quality of life, mortality, and significant health system costs. Knowledge about COPD exacerbations' management in acute hospital admissions in Portugal may help stimulate a national discussion and review of existing data to engage clinicians, policymakers, managers, and patients, raising awareness and promoting action on COPD. Keywords: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Exacerbations Disease management Full Text Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbimortality worldwide, imposing substantial individual, social and economic burdens. Its impact is expected to rise in the upcoming decades due to the continued exposure to risk factors and an accelerated ageing population. 1 7 Although epidemiological data are irregularly distributed worldwide, the estimated worldwide COPD mean prevalence is 13.1% (95% CI 10.2 15.6%), and 12.4% in Europe (95% CI 8.8 16.0%). 8 With the change of smoking habits in recent decades, and although still higher in men, the prevalence and mortality of COPD have increased more rapidly in women. 9 Due to its high prevalence and chronicity, COPD causes substantial resource utilisation with frequent visits to clinicians, frequent hospitalisations due to acute exacerbations, and the need for chronic therapy, creating significant challenges for healthcare systems. 2 , 5 , 10 Available therapy can improve symptoms and quality of life and prevent acute worsening of the disease. 4 Likewise, COPD-appropriate management can decrease symptoms (especially dyspnea), reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, hospitalisations and readmissions, improve health status and exercise capacity, and prolong patient survival. 5 , 11 15 Recently, there has been great interest in the study of COPD phenotypes and with the personalization of the treatment of COPD based on a phenotypical approach, there has been a change in non-pharmacological and pharmacological management of COPD. 16 A better knowledge of the clinical performance and the identification of different factors associated with patients' outcomes are crucial to improving the quality of care for COPD patients 17 . Furthermore, understanding all levels of standard practice can provide an opportunity for targeted quality improvement interventions that could significantly impact patients' care. 18 Several observational studies, have shown COPD management in real-life setting and provide useful information for establishing appropriate clinical care. Esteban and colleagues identified that dyspnoea at baseline was the main variable associated with 30-day mortality after an emergency department evaluation for exacerbation of COPD, followed by the presence of cardiac disease, age, use of inspiratory accessory muscle/ paradoxical breathing, and the Glasgow Coma Scale score. 19 Another study found that the factors associated with a higher probability of hospital admission of COPD patients due to respiratory causes were smoking and receiving oxygen therapy, whereas re-admissions were associated with being men, aged 70 years and over, and a smoker. 20 These factors, as shown by Terzano and colleagues have implications to the length and cost of hospitalization. 21 This study aimed to evaluate the clinical practice, clinical factors, and the outcomes of patients admitted for COPD exacerbations in Portuguese hospitals. Secondary objectives included characterisation of disease profile in hospitalised patients, the assessment of treatment and resources used; patients' outcomes assessment at 60-days after hospital discharge; and compliance with the GOLD guidelines' appraisal. Material and methods Study design Observational, multicentre, prospective study with a 60-days follow-up period. Population Male and female patients aged 30 years, admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours due to an acute exacerbation of COPD, who have given their written informed consent for study participation. Data collection and study assessments During the screening phase of 16-weeks, all consecutive cases admitted to hospital with a suspicion of a COPD exacerbation were identified upon admission, and the patients were invited to participate in the study. At discharge, if COPD exacerbation was confirmed as the cause of admission and the eligibility criteria were met, the patient was included in the study. The data were retrospectively recorded). For eligible patients, demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, patients' referral, smoking habits, hospital readmissions, pulmonary function, comorbidities, and specific data on COPD as COPD symptoms and treatment. At follow-up, 60 7 days after discharge, COPD exacerbations management, outcome measures, and readmission data were evaluated through a structured phone interview. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalisation, hospital readmissions, and mortality at 60-days after hospital discharge. Ethical aspects This study was approved by the study sites' institutional review boards or ethics committees. The work described has been carried out according to the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical and Pharmacoepidemiological Practices, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and maintaining patients' confidentiality. Written informed consent was obtained from all individual participants involved in the study. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Mean, median and interquartile range were used for quantitative variables and the absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative ones. Statistical analysis was performed with R software. Results Sites and recruitment Eleven hospitals participated in the study, and between December 2016 and July 2017, 196 patients were included ( Table 1 ). The follow-up period was complete on 30 th September 2017. Table 1. Participant hospitals and recruitment.

Ex-smokers and active smokers represented 51.0% and 35.7% of the sample, respectively, and 35.7% had been hospitalized at least once for COPD exacerbation in the preceding year. Charlson's comorbidities index score was between 1 and 3 for 77.5% and 4 for 16.8% of the enrolled patients. Regarding respiratory symptoms, 54.1% of the admitted patients presented worsening dyspnea, increased sputum production, and change in sputum colour; 24.5% with only one symptom (96.9% with worsening dyspnea, 71.9% had increased sputum production, and 55.6% a change in sputum colour).

Spirometry results were available for 5.9% of the patients. A medical appointment and exams were scheduled within 60 days after discharge for 94.1% (n=176) and 27.3% (n=51) of the discharged patients. 60 days follow-up Follow-up was completed for 96.3% (n=180) of the discharged patients. Three patients died after hospital discharge; two of these deaths were COPD-related. Of the 187 discharged patients, 44.4% (n=83) had the medical appointment scheduled at discharge, and 28.3% (n=53) were admitted to the emergency department due to a COPD exacerbation. From these, 52.8% (n=28) were hospitalised. Spirometry results were available for 9.5% of the patients, 75% of whom had a scheduled medical appointment ( Table 4 ). Table 4.

Discussion COPD is a leading cause of death worldwide, representing a substantial and increasing socioeconomic burden. 6 Since COPD is associated with long-term exposure to toxic gases and particles, more people will express the long-term effects of exposure to risk factors as longevity increases. 1 , 2 , 6 COPD prevalence is expected to rise over the next 40 years: by 2060 over 5.4 million deaths per year from COPD and related conditions are estimated. 6 , 22 Disease clinical course can vary from years of stability to devastating acute exacerbations and respiratory failure, symptoms ranging from chronic productive cough to debilitating dyspnea. 23 An increasingly severe inflammation characterises disease worsening during stable condition and by an intensifying frequency of exacerbations, the most relevant event affecting COPD mortality. 6 , 11 , 24 The severity of COPD is directly related to the cost of care, and the cost increases as the disease progress. COPD exacerbations are a major cause of the high 30-day hospital readmission rates associated with COPD. 14 Severe COPD exacerbations that result in hospitalisation can be up to 60 times more expensive than mild or moderate exacerbations managed by primary care services. 25 Moreover, exacerbations are associated with impaired lung function and quality of life, mortality, and significant health system costs, accounting for the greatest proportion of the total COPD burden on healthcare systems. 6 , 7 , 14 , 18 , 26 Morbidity measures traditionally include physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Available data indicate that COPD morbidity increases with age and may be affected by concurrent chronic conditions that are smoking-, ageing- and COPD-related, which may interfere with disease management and are the primary drivers of hospitalisations, and costs for patients with COPD. 6 , 27 30 Patients with COPD have a mortality rate higher than the general population, depending on their disease severity. 31 , 32 However, the reduced accuracy of mortality data is associated with the under-recognition and under-diagnosis of COPD, which, together with the uncertainty of diagnosis, contribute to underestimating the disease and its burden. 2 , 6 , 26 , 33 The high prevalence of COPD coupled with the widespread under-recognition and under-diagnosis of the disease stresses the need to raise COPD awareness. 34 , 35 Aiming to know the Portuguese reality regarding COPD, COPD exacerbations and its management, and to compare it with the GOLD guidelines, this study analysed the participating hospitals' clinical outcomes and organisational data, providing evidence to support a better organization of patients care and improved use of resources within Portugal. Consistently with the literature, the patients included in the study were mostly older men (mean age 71 years old, male to female ratio 6:1), a third of whom still smoked, with moderate to severe spirometric disease, a history of hospitalisation for COPD exacerbations and several comorbidities. Readmissions for recurrence of exacerbations in this population were also frequent, as found by the European COPD audit involving > 400 hospitals that reported a 90-day readmission rate of 35.1%. 36 Similar results were found in the ECLIPSE study, in which COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission were relatively frequent events occurring in about 30% of patients during the 3-year follow-up. 37 In Portugal, frequent acute exacerbations were reported by 38.0% of stable COPD outpatients over 40 years old. 38 The mortality was lower than in previous studies involving these patients (exacerbators with poor lung function). 37 This difference might be explained by the more common use of non-invasive ventilation in Portuguese hospitals, shown to reduce mortality in COPD patients. 39 , 40 Nasal high flow oxygen therapy has been used for the management of respiratory failure, complementarily and as an alternative non-invasive respiratory support. 41 However, little and limited evidence for improved clinical outcomes is currently available. Telemonitoring can be important to predict exacerbations by monitoring symptoms and biological variables such as oximetry, physical activity and temperature. It may also be useful in post-exacerbation discharge and to avoid re-aggravation of symptoms and re-exacerbations. 42 Compliance with GOLD guidelines regarding diagnosis was established, as COPD diagnosis was considered for patients with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease, and a post-bronchodilator FEC 1 /FVC < 0.70 confirming the presence of persistent airflow limitation. To define therapy, COPD assessment must consider the presence and severity of spirometric abnormalities, current nature and magnitude of patients' symptoms, exacerbation history, and risk of future events, namely exacerbations, hospital admissions, death, and presence of comorbidities. 12 Pharmacologic therapy for COPD is used to treat symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance and health status. The factors associated with successful treatment should be considered, not only those relying on patients, but also on health-care providers and on the relation between them. One study in Portuguese COPD patients showed that the adherence to medication was higher in patients with more symptoms and more obstructed, whereas previous COPD exacerbations improved prescribers adherence to treatment guidelines. 43 However, it failed to prove a positive association between non-adherence to medication, inhalers mishandling or prescribers non-adherence to GOLD strategy with symptoms, exacerbations, and airflow limitation. 43 In this study, the medications used to treat COPD included bronchodilators LABAs and/or LAMAs and ICS, and recommended treatments ranged from a single short-or long-acting bronchodilator to combinations of two bronchodilators and ICS. This is compliant with the international guidelines regarding in-hospital treatment and shows a high standard of care. 6 , 12 , 26 , 44 The small sample size is the main limitation of the study. Although the incidence of COPD is high, the Portuguese centres still have some difficulties to overcome in the development of clinical investigation studies, including the low organisational capacity which causes some barriers to the recruitment of patients. Additionally, in some hospitals, these organisational problems include difficulties with informatics, and there was a lack of information, namely spirometric data, not because they did not exist, but because they were unavailable at the moment of data registry for the study. The development of studies with these characteristics may help to professionalise clinical investigation and, ultimately, with more knowledge about the global panorama, to improve patients care. Conclusions The presented COPD study evaluated COPD exacerbations' management in acute hospital admissions in Portugal, aiming to raise the standards of care to a level consistent with the GOLD management guidelines. Furthermore, the results obtained from this study may help stimulate a national discussion and review of existing data to engage clinicians, policymakers, managers, and patients, raising awareness and promoting action on COPD.

Our objective was to obtain an overview of the characteristics, resources, techniques and behaviors in national interventional pulmonology (IP) units, before and after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Materials and Methods An online survey was developed by an expert panel with a total of 46 questions comprising the specifications of each unit, namely physical space, equipment, staff, procedure planning, monitoring, technical differentiation, and numbers pre- and post-COVID-19. Forty-one interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate between April and May 2021. Results 37 units (90.2%) responded to the survey. The majority (64.9%) have a fully dedicated space with a weekly presence of 3 chest physicians (82.1%) and support of an anesthesiologist on specific days (48.6%). There is marked heterogeneity in the IP unit's equipment, and 56.8% acquired disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Pre-bronchoscopy hemogram, platelet count and coagulation tests are regularly asked by more than 90% of the units, even when deep sedation or biopsies are not planned. In 97.3% of cases, topical anesthesia and midazolam are utilized. Propofol (21.6%) and fentanyl (29.7%) are occasionally employed in some institutions. Most units use ancillary sampling techniques to diagnose central or peripheral lesions, with radial EBUS being used for guidance of distal procedures in 37.8% of centers, linear EBUS and EUS-B-FNA for mediastinal diagnosis and/or staging in 45.9% and 27.0% of units, respectively. Cryobiopsies are used by 21.6% of respondents to diagnose diffuse lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in 37.8% of centers. There was a decrease in the number of flexible ( p < 0.001) and rigid ( p = 0.005) bronchoscopies and an upscale of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions IP units have variable bronchoscopic practices, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they complied with most international recommendations, as elective procedures were postponed and PPE levels increased. KEYWORDS: Bronchoscopy COVID-19 Survey Questionnaire Pulmonology Full Text Introduction Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (IP) has evolved significantly in the last 20 years, with the development of technologies and practices. Despite the existence of several guidelines from international associations and institutions, most are recommendations set by experts in this field and more focused on safety and functional aspects than in robust scientific evidence, so procedures are usually not standardised. 1 7 Considering the existing variance of methods and the little knowledge about bronchoscopy practices, several countries undertook national surveys to characterize the availability of resources, the clinical application of techniques, and its specificities. 8 15 In 2018, a national study was published evaluating, specifically, the use of pleuroscopy in Portuguese pulmonology departments, considering availability, professionals experience and training, number of procedures and its characteristics. 16 Recently, because of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, the Portuguese Pulmonology Society published a consensus statement aiming at the safety of both patients, medical practitioners and other health professionals during bronchoscopy and pleural procedures. 17 Based on current knowledge, all patients should be assumed as potentially infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); therefore, specific measures must be implemented, including organizational issues, physical space and material preparation, and personal protection equipment (PPE) of all professionals involved. 17 These recent changes in the bronchology field were expected to have a major impact on national interventional pulmonology units, so the Committee on Endoscopic Techniques of the Portuguese Pulmonology Society nominated a working group to conduct a national survey, to accurately characterize the Portuguese panorama. Specifically, this survey aimed to quantify and qualify the human and technical resources of the Portuguese Pulmonology Departments, the specificities of the bronchoscopic procedures performed, and compare the reality before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The expert panel developed a structured questionnaire in Google Forms, and the link was e-mailed to the Bronchology Units or Pulmonology Departments of all Portuguese public hospitals and some private institutions/hospitals considering their representativeness ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Respondents had one month to reply and send the completed form; one reminder was sent to all, and those who did not answer were further contacted by phone. The survey occurred between 22 nd April and 31 st May 2021. The questionnaire comprised 46 questions, either of quantitative or multiple option answer, considering the following sections: 1) respondent and hospital identification; 2) Interventional Pulmonology Unit characterization; 3) staff experience in bronchology; 4) nursing and 5) anesthesiology support; 6) equipment characterization; 7) planning and monitoring of the bronchoscopic procedures, including procedure specifications (e.g. complementary diagnostic tests before bronchoscopy, methods of sedation and patient monitoring); 8) endoscopist PPE pre and post the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic; 9) accessory diagnostic and therapy techniques by flexible bronchoscopy, including the number of procedures pre and post COVID-19; and 10) rigid bronchoscopy, comprising the number of procedures pre and post COVID-19. Responses were downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet. Descriptive analysis was performed using the software SPSSv24 . The survey results were analyzed based on the total number of answers to each question and are presented as mean standard deviation and median (range) for continuous variables, and as frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Paired samples t-student test was used to compare the means of two variables of the same sample measured in sequential years. A difference of at least 5% (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 41 eligible Portuguese interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate ( Supplementary table 1 ), and 37 (90.2%) answered the entire online questionnaire. The responders included in this analysis are listed by their district in Fig. 1 and represent almost all geographic locations in the country . Fig. 1. Participating centers geographical distribution. (0.12MB). General characterization of the IP units The units were located on nine university public hospitals, 23 tertiary public hospitals, and two private hospitals. In 24 cases (64.9%), the unit space was fully dedicated to bronchoscopy/pleural procedures; in 12 (32.4%), the physical location was shared with other specialties, and in one case, the procedures were performed in a hospital operating room. Thirty IP units (81.1%) reported the weekly presence of three or more chest physicians performing the procedures, six (16.2%) had the regular presence of two pulmonologists, and one (2.7%) relied on one doctor. Regarding the existence of dedicated nurses with specific IP training, three units (8.1%) stated the usual presence of one nurse, 13 (35.1%) referred two rotating nurses, ten units (27%) three nurses, and another 10 (27%), four or more nurses. One unit indicated the absence of trained nurses. Eighteen units (48.6%) had the regular support of an anesthesiologist on specific weekdays. In 15 cases (40.5%), an anesthesiologist was present in the bronchoscopy suite-only upon request. This occurred on 1-2 days/week in 16 cases, 3-4 days/week in two cases and five days/week in other two units (totally dedicated to cancer patients). Four units (10.8%) had no assistance from an anesthesiologist. On a regular year, the IP units reported an average of nearly 500 flexible bronchoscopies per year. However, great heterogeneity was observed with 14 centers (37.8%) registering 500 exams/year or more, 18 (48.6%) 200 to 499 exams/year and five (13,5%) less than 200 exams/year. Overall, we were able to analyze the profile of 103 pulmonologists. Of these, 41 (39.8%) had over 15 years of experience in bronchoscopy, 23 (22.3%) had 10 to 14 years of previous experience, 25 (24.3%) had 5 to 9 years, and 14 (13.6%) had less than 5 five years of IP experience. Concerning the areas of expertise, all answering chest physicians had experience in flexible bronchoscopy, while 37 (35.9%) reported proficiency in rigid bronchoscopy and 37 (35.9%) in endobronchial ultrasound. Pleuroscopy/medical thoracoscopy was performed by 46 (44.6%) of the respondents and was reported to be available in 20 centers. Table 1 shows the unit's equipment. Most units (56.8%) promoted the acquisition of disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Twenty-five health care facilities (67.6%) reported using automatic high-level disinfection to reprocess their reusable bronchoscopes and accessories. In 11 hospitals (29.7%), sterilization was the reported selected method, if available, because of its greater efficacy in reducing microorganism's contamination. In one unit (2.7%), the cleaning and disinfection of the equipment was entirely manual. After reprocessing, to minimize the likelihood of recontamination, the equipment was stored in ventilated cabinets in 19 units (51.4%) and in non-ventilated facilities in 18 units (48.6%). Table 1.

Similarly, most proceduralists (89.2%) require more than one pre-procedure complimentary exam when sedation or biopsies are planned Table 2 . presents the complementary exams asked in each situation.

The most common drug used by the pulmonologists for sedation was midazolam in 97.3% of units ( usually n = 25, or sometimes n = 11). Propofol and fentanyl were occasionally employed during bronchoscopy in 8 (21.6%) and 11 (29.7%) institutions, respectively. Twenty-nine respondents (78.4%) affirmed that supplemental oxygen was routinely administered since the beginning of each flexible bronchoscopy. In contrast, the remaining eight (21.6%) participants showed a preference in administering supplemental oxygen only if required due to peripheral oxygen desaturation during the procedure. When asked about the patient's monitoring during flexible bronchoscopy without deep sedation, all 37 participants referred to assessing heart rate and pulse oximetry throughout the procedure. Non-invasive blood pressure was measured by 33 respondents (89.2%), and ECG monitoring was monitored by 23 participants (62.2%). When deep sedation was planned, end-tidal CO 2 was evaluated by one participant unit (2.7%), monitor ECG was performed by 31 participants (83.8%), non-invasive blood pressure by 35 (94.6%), and all respondents referred to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry. In both scenarios, one respondent added clinical observation, and another external pace defibrillator monitoring. Bronchoscopy technical features Regarding the diagnosis of central/tracheobronchial lesions by flexible bronchoscopy, biopsy forceps were used by all 37 participant units; bronchial brushings by 36 (97.3%); and needle aspiration by 31 (83.8%). Bronchial cryobiopsies were reported by seven (18.9%) participants. Cryobiopsies were also the least reported procedure in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions, used by six (16.2%) respondents. Peripheral biopsy forceps and brushing were among the most used procedures for diagnosing peripheral lesions, reported by 33 (89.1%) participants in both cases. Radial EBUS and fluoroscopy were used as guidance for distal procedures in 14 (37.8%) and 10 (27.0%) centers, respectively. In diffuse lung diseases, bronchoalveolar lavage was the preferred method, reported by all 37 centers. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were used by 33 (89.2%) of the participants, while eight centers (21.6%) reported performing transbronchial lung cryobiopsies. Fluoroscopy was used by seven centers (18.9%) to guide the adjunctive procedures for the diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases. In what concerns the diagnosis of mediastinal lesions, non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was used by 32 centers (86.5%). In contrast, EBUS-TBNA was used by 17 centers (45.9%) and EUS-B-FNA in 10 centers (27.0%). Concerning therapeutic techniques, 34 (91.9%) centers reported using flexible bronchoscopy to remove foreign bodies. Control of hemoptysis was attempted through balloon tamponade by 30 (81.0%) centers, whereas 31 (83.8%) units used some form of thermal energy, of which LASER was the preferred, employed by 14 (37.8%) centers, followed by argon-plasma coagulation, used by 10 (27.0%) centers. Airway repermeabilization through self-expandable stents placed through flexible bronchoscopy was reported by 7 (18.9%) centers. Other endobronchial therapeutic maneuvers such as bronchial thermoplasty and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (with one-way valves, coils or thermal ablation) were not reported by any center. The average number of flexible bronchoscopies reported to have been performed by all 37 participant centers in 2020 (amid the COVID-19 pandemic) was 345 ( 249). When asked about the estimated annual number of flexible bronchoscopies performed during 2019 (before the pandemic), the reported average number was 500 ( 346). There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of bronchoscopies performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised to an average of -155 ( p < 0.001). The distribution of reported exams and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of flexible bronchoscopy is reported in detail in Table 3 . In 2020, on average, 84% ( 12.6%) of flexible bronchoscopy procedures were performed mainly with a diagnostic intent. Table 3. Estimated annual number of flexible bronchoscopies in 2019 and 2020. Number of flexible bronchoscopies Reported number of centers (2019) Reported number of centers (2020) >1000 4 1 500-999 10 8 250-499 13 14 100-249 10 10 <100 0 4 Seventeen IP units reported to have a rigid bronchoscope and 14 referred to perform the procedure. Proceduralists used rigid bronchoscopy to conduct one or more adjunctive procedures: 100% mechanical debulking ( usually n = 12; or sometimes n = 2); 57.1% LASER ablation ( usually n = 7; or sometimes n = 1); 57.1% argon-plasma coagulation ( usually n = 6; or sometimes n = 2); 50% electrosurgery ( usually n = 3; or sometimes n = 4); 50% cryoablation ( usually n = 2; or sometimes n = 5). Eleven centers (29.7%) reported airway stenting deployment by rigid bronchoscopy to maintain tracheobronchial patency. Between all commercially available, the Dumon (straight or Y) and Hood stents were the most frequently used in the Portuguese IP units (Dumon n = 11, Hood n = 8, Ultraflex n = 5, Polyflex n = 4, Silmet n = 4, Dynamic Y-stent n = 3, Montgomery T-tube n = 3, Aerstent n = 2, Micro-tech n = 1, Noppen n = 1 unit). Several airway stent complications were commonly reported by most centers, being the most frequent: stent migration ( n = 11), obstruction by secretions ( n = 10), obstruction by granulation tissue ( n = 10), chronic cough ( n = 5), and infection ( n = 3). Of these 14 units performing rigid bronchoscopy, 11 retrieved their estimated annual number of procedures performed both in 2020 and also on a regular year (before the COVID-19 pandemic). On average, IP units performed 96 99.3 (range 7-302) rigid bronchoscopies during 2019 (before the pandemic), whereas in 2020, the average number of reported rigid bronchoscopy was 70 81.2 (range 0-237). When assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rigid bronchoscopy overall workload, a statistically significant average decrease of 26 procedures was observed ( p = 0.005). Health professionals' protection When asked about the current use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during interventional bronchoscopy, all 37 units confirmed choosing FFP2/N95 single-use face masks (four in combination with a surgical face mask), some sort of eye protection, single-use gown and single-use waterproof gloves Table 4 . presents the standard PPE reported to be used in 2019 (before the pandemic) and afterwards.

This was a comprehensive and extended questionnaire that was able to assess the prevalence of the practice in the country and the impact of COVID-19 at a national level. It is evident that the number and type of procedures performed decreased during the pandemic period; most units equipped themselves with disposable bronchoscopes, and there was a shift in the type and level of protective equipment used to increase safety for staff and patients. Surveys in IP have been published since the 90s. 10 When compared to some historical questionnaires that were able to provide the clinical picture of bronchoscopy in North America and in some European countries, much as evolved regarding practice and technical developments. The number and indications of rigid bronchoscopies have declined, new techniques have emerged (e.g., EBUS and cryobiopsies), sedation and anesthesia are now regarded as mandatory in most units and demanded by patients. The survey response rate was very high, and the findings reveal, as expected, the national panorama, in which the majority of centers are based in Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas and in the coastal region, where more than half of the Portuguese population lives. 18 Most units (65%) are fully dedicated to bronchoscopy, more than 90% have two or more trained pulmonologists, and in 84% of cases, at least one has at least ten years of IP experience. In contrast, 46% of units have two or fewer nurses, and most of them are not fully dedicated to bronchoscopy. It is worth mentioning that there is no specific post-graduation education in IP for nurses in the country. We may speculate that the small number of nurses trained and committed to this area may impact the quality of the exams. The British Thoracic Society advised the presence of at least two qualified nurses during bronchoscopy. 1 In contrast, the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society instruct on the need for one to two dedicated nurses during interventional pulmonology procedures without anesthesia (with a third nurse required to help the anesthesiologist in the procedures performed under deep sedation / general anesthesia). 2 Therefore, efforts should be made to assure that nursing staff receives adequate standardized training in IP and that all units move on to comply with international recommendations and demand the regular presence of an adequate number of trained nurses. This number may vary depending on the workflow volume of the individual units. Still, it should not be less than two (with possible rotation) in low volume units, to at least three (non-rotating) in high volume units that perform advanced interventional bronchoscopy and have regular anesthesiology support. There is great heterogeneity in technical resources and equipment between IP units, with more than half performing only basic exams. A third uses rigid bronchoscopy, which is sufficient for the country necessities, according to the number of habitants. In 2019, 16 centers performed linear EBUS, whereas in 2014 only six did it, as reported by the Survey of Pulmonology Services, prepared as part of the review of the Pulmonology Referral Network. 19 This expansion follows the natural evolution of IP units worldwide since EBUS is an important tool for mediastinal staging in lung cancer patients and in diagnosing malignant or benign lesions adjacent to the tracheobronchial tree or the oesophagus. 20 For the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules, 14 units have radial EBUS, ten fluoroscopy and two have electromagnetic navigation, which enables an increase in diagnostic accuracy. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 56.8% of the units now have single-use bronchoscopes, which were not regularly utilized. This equipment will certainly have an increasing application in the near future due to its benefits regarding the risk of contamination, availability and preserved efficacy in most emergent clinical scenarios. 21 Concerning the number of procedures per year, the present survey shows a clear negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period, with a decrease by 30% on the average number of flexible bronchoscopies and 27% on rigid bronchoscopies. This is in line with other published studies, 22 24 where IP procedure work-load considerably decreased or was even abolished during the COVID-19 era. Elective procedures in COVID-19 negative patients were postponed and rescheduled as recommended by consensus guidelines. 17 , 25 Some kind of sedation/anesthesia is required to reduce patient's discomfort, enhance safety 6 , 26 reduce procedure duration and increase diagnostic accuracy. The preferred method for bronchoscopic diagnostic procedures is conscious sedation with antianxiety and/or analgesic medications, in combination with local anesthesia, titrated by bronchoscopists and supervised by the team. Most guidelines suggest the combination of a sedative agent with an opioid since it decreases cough and pain, improves patients tolerance, and reduces the total dose of sedative drugs. 27 In the present assessment, more than 97% of the IP units in the country confirmed the use of midazolam. Still, only 29.7% associated an opioid, probably due to a reduced experience with this medication and fear of complications in patients with previous respiratory diseases. These results are in-line with other real-life studies. 11 , 28 It is worth mentioning that conscious sedation has limitations, and prolonged, complex, and technically demanding bronchoscopies or therapeutic procedures usually require deeper sedation/general anesthesia with the support of an anesthesiologist, not involved in the intervention itself. 29 The survey identified the lack of available anesthesiologists as a potential problem, with only 5% and 48.6% of the units having the collaboration of this specialty on a daily or regular basis, respectively. As pre-procedural requirements, nearly all responders ask routinely for a full blood count (97%), coagulation studies (92%), renal function (86%) and an electrocardiogram, even when there is no history of abnormal coagulation or cardiac risk. These numbers are much higher when compared to other published surveys. In 2002, in the United Kingdom, when performing bronchoscopy without transbronchial biopsy, physicians routinely asked for a full blood count in 57%, blood urea and electrolytes in 43% and clotting function in 18% of cases. When a transbronchial biopsy is needed, 91% asked for a full blood count and 88% asked for clotting tests. 12 This highlights the deviation of real-life performance compared to international guidelines and current scientific literature, which states that the routine performance of coagulation studies, platelet counts, and hemoglobin levels before flexible bronchoscopy is not recommended, especially when there are no previous identifiable risk factors. 26 , 30 On the other hand, a pre-procedural chest CT scan was not consistently required by 32,4% of participants. Though we acknowledge that a chest CT can be dismissed upon emergent situations (mainly emergent therapeutic bronchoscopy), the number of centers that reported inconsistent demand of this valuable exam was concerning. Again, we stress the need to standardize procedures and comply with international recommendations that underline the importance of CT in preparation for bronchoscopy. 1 , 2 , 19 Clinical evaluation should dictate other pre-bronchoscopy investigations on an individual basis, and this should be stressed to avoid submitting the patients to unnecessary exams and increase healthcare costs. According to the recommendations of a few guidelines, 26 , 30 and good clinical practice, all Portuguese units monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation, and generally add non-invasive blood pressure and continuous ECG in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, especially when deep sedation is planned. It is recognized that deficient monitoring in deep sedation may lead to unnoticed respiratory depression, changes in normal blood pressure and arrhythmia, which increase the probability of complications during bronchoscopy. This awareness was acquired especially in the last two decades, compared to the survey conducted by Smyth et al, where only 22% and 10% of physicians reported monitoring ECG and blood pressure, respectively. 12 A recent systematic review by Strohleit et al, 27 reinforces the idea that there is still the need for further research in this area due to the scarcity of evidence of published papers. In the current study, most units combine biopsy, brushing and needle aspiration for the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions, to obtain the highest diagnostic yield. 31 Compared to other published surveys that proved the underuse of TBNA, 8 we highlight that 83.8% of centers are able to perform non-guided TBNA in central lesions and 86.5% in mediastinal lesions (including centers that also perform EBUS-TBNA). Interestingly, non-guided TBNA accuracy has been reported to benefit from previous EBUS training. 32 Still, we believe that the overlap of both techniques in the same centers can be explained by the formers wider accessibility and lower costs. Although EBUS-TBNA is used in 45.9% of units, EUS-B-FNA is only performed in 27% of centers, probably related to the lack of specific training. This reinforces the need for educational programs in this area for both residents and senior chest physicians. In this survey, transbronchial lung cryobiopsies were performed in a scarce number of hospitals (8 out of 37). This finding perhaps reflects the novelty of this procedure and the need to complete a high volume of procedures, which has been suggested as a requirement to gain and maintain adequate proficiency in this technique. 33 Still, considering transbronchial lung cryobiopsies, we found some important deviations of the current guidelines 34 and expert panel standardization recommendations 35 concerning the utilization of fluoroscopic control, that according to our results, was not available in one center. This practice is not in line with the safety recommendations for this procedure. Though we could not assess other in-depth details, outcomes or complications, we strongly underline the need to comply with the currently available best practice recommendations 34 , 35 to avoid unnecessary risks. Another important finding of our survey was the complete absence of offer, among all respondent centers, of two important and validated endobronchial therapies: bronchial thermoplasty (recommended for selected asthmatic patients in GINA grade 5 of symptomatic control, evidence B) 36 and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction strategies (recommended for selected emphysematous COPD patients with significant lung hyperinflation despite optimal medical care) 37 . The reasons for this finding are out of the scope of this paper but may include national regulatory and reimbursement issues that deserve prompt elucidation. They are crucial regarding infectious control measures, since it has been proved that not sufficiently protected healthcare workers attending or performing aerosol-generating procedures have a higher risk of infection. 38 In 2002, in the UK, a national survey reported that only 9% of physicians used four protective items: face mask, gloves, eye protection, and gown. 12 The recommendations of PPE during bronchoscopy have been upscaled since 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and, again, most units comply with them. The awareness of safety issues of Portuguese bronchoscopists and staff attending the procedures increased noticeably after COVID-19, with 100% of centers using FFP2/N95 masks and eye protection. Recent studies have shown that most proceduralists understand the gravity of the situation and paid particular attention to the use of appropriate PPE, 22 but in real clinical practice, and especially at the peak of the pandemic, some of the international recommendations were quite difficult to follow and implement. 24 , 39 In recent articles, authors report that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be low with consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment by healthcare workers when all the measures are followed. 40 , 41 Meanwhile, on the 26th of November 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) designated the variant B.1.1.529 named Omicron as a variant of concern (VOC), with a considerable rise in cases of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa in regions where the Omicron variant emerged. 42 .This variant, considered to be more contagious and associated with an increase in the risk of reinfection after a primary infection than the previous mutations, shows more than 30 mutations leading to amino-acid changes in the Spike sequence. 43 The question of severity and this new variant is not clear yet. However, it is suggested to be less aggressive. 44 Presently, there are too many confounding factors to compare patients with the Omicron variant with patients infected by other variants. In fact, COVID-19 severity and mortality vary enormously depending on the country, the prevalence of vaccination, the population's characteristics. For these reasons, it is not expected that our level of care as healthcare workers will change in the near future. There are some obvious limitations of our study and all surveys for that matter: answers rely on personal or unit databases and, in some instances, on the memory of participants (there is no national database); lack of objectivity of some responders; differences in question interpretation; replies could not be verified; some topics were simplified and others not covered, to reduce the overall length and avoid a reduced response rate. We also acknowledge that there were questions regarding duration of practice but non-related to training or competence maintenance, and the design questionnaire was not able to assess the quality of procedures which is at least as important as the numbers, equipment or techniques attributed to each unit. Conclusion The present survey assessed present trends and the impact of COVID-19 in bronchoscopy practices in Portugal. It does not provide any recommendations or IP standards as with other questionnaires. It suggests that IP units in the country have a wide range of characteristics and behaviors, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they complied with most international recommendations, as elective procedures were postponed and PPE levels increased. Practice in the bronchoscopy field was previously guided by personal experience, determined by the peculiarities of a particular unit as new members would mimic and adopt the attitudes of older practitioners. Nowadays, there is the need to standardize practice and enhance training and competence maintenance of IP physicians within the country. The current survey helps to understand the reality and may settle the foundations to improve the IP field in Portugal, with the development of a future national database, homogenize procedures and protocols, and even organize and design better training programs.

Up to 50% of patients have residual symptoms and physiologic impairment, particularly dyspnea and reduced diffusion capacity. Studies have also shown that 24% 54% of patients hospitalized during the 1st year of the pandemic exhibit radiologic abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacity, reticular opacity, bronchial dilatation, and air trapping, when imaged more than 1 year after infection. In patients with persistent respiratory symptoms but normal results at chest CT, dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT, xenon 129 MRI, and low-field-strength MRI were reported to show abnormal ventilation and/or perfusion, suggesting that some lung injury may not be detectable with standard CT. Histologic patterns in post COVID-19 lung disease include fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and vascular abnormality, indicating that different pathologic mechanisms may contribute to PCC. Therefore, a comprehensive imaging approach is necessary to evaluate and diagnose patients with persistent post COVID-19 symptoms. This review will focus on the long-term findings of clinical and radiologic abnormalities and describe histopathologic perspectives. It also addresses advanced imaging techniques and deep learning approaches that can be applied to COVID-19 survivors. This field remains an active area of research, and further follow-up studies are warranted for a better understanding of the chronic stage of the disease and developing a multidisciplinary approach for patient management. RSNA, 2024 Download as PowerPoint Summary A comprehensive understanding of long-term respiratory sequelae, residual CT abnormalities, histopathologic findings, and novel imaging markers of chronic lung disease following COVID-19 pneumonia is essential for establishing effective multidisciplinary approaches to treat post-COVID-19 condition. Essentials Although most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia show gradual functional recovery, a subset of patients have persistent dyspnea and impaired pulmonary function, most notably reduced diffusion capacity, at more than 1 year of follow-up. Long-term residual CT abnormalities, including ground-glass opacity, reticular opacity, bronchial dilatation, and air trapping have been observed in 24% 54% of patients who had COVID-19 during the 1st year of the pandemic, and these abnormalities are correlated with functional impairment; thus, CT surveillance can be recommended for symptomatic COVID-19 survivors. In patients with persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection and normal results at chest CT, dual-energy CT, xenon 129 MRI, and low-field-strength MRI can show abnormal ventilation and perfusion patterns, suggesting potential lung injury beyond CT-detectable structural changes. Heterogeneous histologic patterns of chronic lung disease after COVID-19 have been identified, including fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and vascular abnormality, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding and multidisciplinary approach for treating post COVID-19 condition. Introduction COVID-19 is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the acute disease usually lasts 4 weeks from symptom onset. However, some patients may experience persistent symptoms and delayed complications beyond this timeframe. In community-based surveys from both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients, symptoms were present in 15% 18% of patients beyond 4 weeks and in 8% 17% beyond 12 weeks ( 1 ). The risk is more than twice as high in patients who had more severe illness requiring hospitalization or admission to the intensive care unit ( 2 ). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention termed the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as post COVID-19 condition (PCC) or long COVID ( 3 ). These effects have also been termed postacute sequelae of COVID-19, defined as ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms or conditions present 30 or more days after the infection ( 4 ). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines have categorized the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 as ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 if they last 4 12 weeks and as post-COVID syndrome if they persist beyond 12 weeks ( 5 ). The constellation of symptoms associated with PCC encompasses a broad range of respiratory and nonrespiratory manifestations, including but not limited to fatigue, muscle weakness, dyspnea, psychiatric disorders, and sleep disturbances ( 1 , 5 , 6 ), and may lead to substantial clinical and socioeconomic burden ( 1 , 5 , 7 ). Long-term respiratory sequelae of COVID-19 are a result of direct injury of the airway, alveolus, or endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature or the host s immune reaction to those injuries. For instance, inflammation of the airways can result in large and small airways disease in the form of bronchiectasis and constrictive bronchiolitis ( 8 11 ). Furthermore, pulmonary vascular complications include a vasculopathy that results in vasoconstriction and microthrombi ( 12 , 13 ). In addition, diffuse alveolar damage can cause fibrotic changes in the lung parenchyma, leading to pulmonary fibrosis with associated reduction of the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D lco ) ( 14 18 ). All these sequelae can contribute to persistent symptoms, especially dyspnea, in patients with PCC ( 19 , 20 ). The occurrence of PCC varies according to patient characteristics, including age, sex, pre-existing health conditions (eg, obesity and asthma), and viral factors ( 1 , 2 , 6 ). As such, patients with factors that put them at increased risk of COVID-19 related pulmonary sequelae should be followed up to manage potential functional impairments. Imaging, particularly chest CT, plays an important role in the evaluation of pulmonary complications; thus, it is important for radiologists to understand pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia and be familiar with the corresponding imaging findings. Although the underlying mechanisms and clinical course of chronic lung injury after COVID-19 remain partially undefined, an increasing body of literature has provided novel insights. In this review of chronic lung injury after COVID-19 pneumonia, we aim to (a) summarize CT findings in long-term follow-up studies of COVID-19 pneumonia and their clinical significance, (b) briefly review the histopathologic abnormalities seen in chronic lung disease after COVID-19, and (c) describe novel imaging techniques and future directions in evaluating post COVID-19 pneumonia ( Fig 1 ). Most of the data in this review derive from follow-up of individuals who were hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic, but we have included a section on the impact of variants and vaccines on chronic lung injury after COVID-19. Figure 1: Diagram illustrates the clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic findings of chronic COVID-19 pneumonia. More than 1 year after initial COVID-19 pneumonia, a subset of patients continues to experience persistent symptoms and exhibit chest CT abnormalities. The histopathologic characteristics of chronic lung injury resulting from COVID-19 pneumonia encompass a wide spectrum, including disrupted basement membrane, fibrosis and collagen deposition, microclots and vasculopathy, bronchiectasis, and small-airway disease. Residual CT abnormalities include bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolectasis, reticulation, air trapping at expiratory CT, and ground-glass opacities. Even when conventional CT scans show normal findings, photon-counting detector CT, xenon 129 ( 129 Xe) MRI, and low-field-strength MRI can potentially help identify subtle lung parenchymal abnormalities or functional impairment beyond the limits of anatomic resolution. D lco = diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. Figure 1: Download as PowerPoint Pulmonary Functional Abnormalities in PCC Table 1 summarizes studies on persistent dyspnea and long-term abnormalities at pulmonary function testing after SARS-CoV-2 infection ( 21 25 ). In most patients, despite having severe to critical COVID-19 pneumonia, the pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity improved during the follow-up period, which ranged from 1 to 2 years in the presented studies. However, 4% 48% of patients had persistently impaired pulmonary function at more than 1 year of follow-up. A recent study by Zhang et al ( 26 ) described lung function trajectories over 2 years in COVID-19 survivors and reported that although lung function tests improved 6 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they declined during the 2nd year after infection, thus emphasizing the clinical necessity for long-term monitoring of respiratory function. Table 1: Summary of Studies on Dyspnea and Pulmonary Function Testing Abnormalities in Patients after Hospitalization for COVID-19 Pneumonia A series of studies ( 21 26 ) have demonstrated decreased D lco to be the most prevalent long-term respiratory complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Fig 2 ). Many studies have shown that oxygenation is impaired at 3 and 6 months after discharge in patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia ( 27 30 ), and this phenomenon was consistently observed in longer-term follow-up studies exceeding 1 year. Low D lco could result from alveolar membrane disruption or pulmonary vascular abnormalities caused by COVID-19 ( 27 , 30 ). A recent study ( 31 ) demonstrated that the lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide was also significantly affected at 1-year follow-up, suggesting a chronic alteration of alveolar membrane diffusive conductance due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have consistently reported that impaired D lco is more frequent in female than male patients ( 21 , 23 25 ). Additional studies are necessary to clarify the associations between respiratory function, clinical trajectory, and long-term COVID-19 outcomes. Figure 2: Images in a 65-year-old male patient with persistent dyspnea more than 1 year after COVID-19 pneumonia. (A) Axial CT scan obtained 1 week after symptom onset shows diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO) (arrows) in both lungs. (B) Axial CT scan obtained 6 months after hospital admission for COVID-19 shows decreased GGO but residual bronchial dilatation, reticular opacity, and parenchymal bands (dashed circles). (C) Axial CT scan obtained 12 months after hospital admission shows further resolution of GGO but residual mild bronchiectasis and reticular opacity. (D) Graph of serial pulmonary function test results shows gradually improving forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D lco ), which were still below 80% of predicted value at 1 year. Figure 2: Download as PowerPoint Imaging Findings of Chronic Lung Injury after COVID-19 Pneumonia Lung Parenchymal Abnormalities The pathogenesis of chronic lung injury after COVID-19 is multifactorial and represents a combination of direct tissue damage from the viral infection and host immune response, lung injury associated with diffuse alveolar damage, and barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation ( 6 ). Table 2 summarizes the studies on the long-term radiologic outcomes following hospitalization for COVID-19 ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 32 ). The incidence of residual lung abnormalities at CT observed at 1-year follow-up ranged from 24% to 54%. No clear constellation of findings is typical for PCC. The most frequent CT abnormalities at 1 year included ground-glass opacity (GGO), seen in 8% 40% of patients; reticular opacity, seen in 4% 39% of patients; and traction bronchiectasis or bronchial dilatation, seen in 8% 16% of patients. Other findings, such as a crazy paving appearance, mosaic attenuation, subpleural linear or cystic opacities, and parenchymal bands, were also reported. Recently, Han et al ( 22 ) identified lung abnormalities at 2-year follow-up CT in 39% of patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia; these abnormalities were fibrotic-like (architectural distortion with traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing) in 23% of patients and nonfibrotic (GGO or reticular abnormalities) in 16%. A limitation of these studies is that most are based on hospitalized patients and lack pre-COVID imaging. Thus, some of the described abnormalities may represent progression of previously unrecognized lung disease. Table 2: Summary of Studies on Long-term CT Findings of Patients Who Were Hospitalized for COVID-19 Pneumonia Previous studies have shown that various radiologic and clinical characteristics are associated with long-term residual CT abnormalities ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 32 34 ). Radiologic measures, such as peak CT pneumonia score during hospitalization ( 21 ) and chest radiography score at admission ( 25 ), were reported to be predictive of long-lasting CT abnormality at 1 year. In addition, clinical characteristics, such as older age, severity of acute COVID-19, variant of SARS-CoV-2, severity of lung injury in the form of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, male sex, high serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and lymphopenia, were identified to be predictive of residual 1-year CT abnormalities ( 25 , 32 , 34 , 35 ). The CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia gradually improve during longitudinal follow-up, even in patients who were critically ill ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 32 , 33 ). However, evaluation for residual CT abnormalities is warranted, particularly for patients with persistent symptoms, because long-lasting lesions can be associated with impaired pulmonary functional recovery ( 21 ). Han et al ( 22 ) reported that the presence of interstitial abnormality at 2-year follow-up CT, especially fibrotic-like abnormality, is associated with abnormal D lco . Considering the association between residual CT abnormalities and pulmonary function impairment, surveillance with follow-up CT is important for COVID-19 survivors. Further evidence is needed to set specific recommendations regarding the timelines of these follow-up CT examinations. Airway Changes The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is expressed throughout the airway tree and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the virus can directly infect and injure the airway and may result in small airways obstruction ( 8 , 10 , 36 ). Studies evaluating paired inspiratory and expiratory CT have shown evidence of a high prevalence of small airway disease in patients with prolonged symptoms after COVID-19 pneumonia. Franquet et al ( 11 ) reported that 77% of patients with sustained respiratory symptoms showed air trapping at expiratory CT at least 30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. Cho et al ( 10 ) reported that patients with long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19 had greater air trapping at expiratory CT compared with the healthy controls, regardless of the initial severity of infection. The authors hypothesized that the presence of significant air trapping reflects persistent bronchiolar inflammation or postviral constrictive bronchiolitis as a form of PCC. In a study of 205 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia ( 9 ), air trapping was seen at expiratory CT in 29% of patients at 6-month follow-up, especially in patients with severe pneumonia ( Fig 3 ). However, these studies lack pre-infection CT scans, making it difficult to definitively establish a causal relationship between air trapping and COVID-19 pneumonia ( 37 ). A comprehensive longitudinal investigation is needed to elucidate the temporal changes and clinical significance of air trapping in COVID-19 survivors. Although further research is needed, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT is still recommended for individuals with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 to evaluate for small airway disease. Despite the prevalence of post-COVID airways disease, the literature provides no guidance for its treatment. Although inhaled corticosteroids were found to be potentially effective in resolving COVID-related symptoms during the acute phase ( 38 ), no studies have evaluated their use in the post-COVID setting. However, if patients have symptoms attributable to radiologic and/or physiologic evidence of small airways disease, they are often treated with inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting -agonists. Further studies on the clinical significance and management of post-COVID airways disease are needed. Figure 3: Chest CT images in a 59-year-old female patient with dyspnea 8 months after COVID-19. Representative axial images from (A, C) inspiratory and (B, D) expiratory noncontrast chest CT show multifocal areas of low attenuation due to air trapping (arrows in B and D ), suggestive of postviral constrictive bronchiolitis. Figure 3: Download as PowerPoint Bronchial wall thickening (found in 12.5% 22.9%), and bronchiectasis (found in 19%) are commonly reported in both the acute and chronic stages of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in patients who experienced severe illness ( 11 , 39 , 40 ). Traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis at long-term follow-up CT (pathologic fibrosis) is most commonly a sequela of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome but could also represent post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis. However, the term traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis should be used with caution because bronchial dilatation seen in areas of consolidation or GGO in COVID-19 can be completely or partially reversible at follow-up CT ( Fig 2 ) ( 34 , 41 ). Pulmonary Vascular Disease Pulmonary endothelial injury after COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained by both direct viral cytopathic injury and an indirect immune-mediated inflammatory response ( 8 , 42 , 43 ). These processes can result in endothelial dysfunction, a continued upregulation of coagulation pathways, vasoconstriction, and, eventually, pulmonary vascular inflammation and thrombosis ( 12 , 44 ). Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major vascular abnormality associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and is easily detected with conventional contrast-enhanced CT ( 45 , 46 ). A meta-analysis that included 27 studies with 3342 patients who presented with various levels of disease severity suggested that the pooled incidence of PE and deep vein thrombosis is as high as 16.5% and 14.8%, respectively, in patients with COVID-19 ( 45 ). In addition, dual-energy CT has been reported to show abnormal lung perfusion in patients with acute COVID but without PE, presumably because of intrapulmonary shunting ( 47 ). Pulmonary vascular abnormalities and perfusion abnormalities have been reported in long-term follow-up studies of patients who had COVID-19 pneumonia. A recent investigation ( 13 ) comprising 79 patients with persistent COVID-19 symptoms revealed acute PE in 2.5% and chronic PE in 5% of cases, as evidenced with dual-energy CT conducted a median of 8 months after infection ( Fig 4 ). Furthermore, perfusion abnormalities were observed in 87.4% of patients, indicating sustained hypercoagulability and microangiopathy ( 13 ) ( Fig 5 ). The Swedish national registry data also showed an elevated incidence rate ratio of 1.40 for PE in patients at 91 180 days compared with before SARS-CoV-2 infection ( 48 ). A study including 44 patients ( 49 ) demonstrated that 36% of patients had perfusion defects at dual-energy CT at 2 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the presence of perfusion defects was associated with significantly higher rates of persistent symptoms, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and cough. Microthrombi, resistant to fibrinolysis, have also been detected in blood samples from patients with PCC and attributed to thrombus formation ( 50 ). This hypercoagulable status with reduced fibrinolytic capacity and resultant microthrombosis in patients with COVID-19 may result in vascular tree-in-bud pattern at CT ( 8 ). Another study ( 51 ) demonstrated a decrease in vascular density at sublingual videomicroscopy that appeared to exclusively affect small capillaries in patients with PCC compared with healthy controls. This decrease in vascular density was apparent even 18 months after infection; this may indicate reduction of peripheral blood vessels and reduction of pulmonary microcirculation, explaining a mechanism for perfusion abnormalities. Figure 4: CT images show a pulmonary embolus 7 months after COVID-19 pneumonia in an 85-year-old woman, who visited the emergency department for aggravated dyspnea. (A, B) Coronal CT images obtained 7 weeks after symptom onset show ground-glass opacity (GGO) and bronchial dilatation at the left upper lobe (dashed circle in A ). (C, D) Coronal CT images obtained 7 months after the infection show improvement of GGO (dashed circle in C ). However, a newly developed pulmonary embolus is present in the right pulmonary artery (arrow in D ). Figure 4: Download as PowerPoint Figure 5: Lung perfusion abnormality in chronic COVID-19 pneumonia in a 51-year-old man with mild persistent exertional dyspnea. (A, B) Axial CT images obtained 1 week after symptom onset show diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs peripherally. (C, D) Axial CT images obtained 1 year after COVID-19 show near-complete resolution of GGO with residual mild bronchial dilatation and linear opacities. (E, F) Iodine density maps generated from 1-year follow-up CT scans (shown in C and D ) demonstrate multifocal perfusion defects (dashed circles). Figure 5: Download as PowerPoint Lung perfusion abnormalities in COVID-19 may consist of a mixture of classic segmental defects and less typical distal vessel-related abnormality; such lesions could be subtle and easily missed ( 52 ). However, the venous thromboembolism and in situ small-vessel pulmonary thromboses in COVID-19 could be a precursor to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( 52 ). Although these abnormalities may be detected at ventilation perfusion planar scintigraphy or SPECT, dual-energy CT has the advantage of simultaneously providing morphologic and perfusion information. In a dual-energy CT study of 78 patients attending a post-COVID clinic 6 months after infection, the iodine perfusion score was correlated with D lco and with breathlessness ( 53 ). Thus, in patients with persistent symptoms, CT pulmonary angiography and dual-energy CT should be considered to evaluate for long-term pulmonary vascular sequelae of COVID-19. Many different society- and government-sponsored guidelines for the use of anticoagulation in COVID-19 have been released. Because of concern over excessive venous thromboembolism early in the pandemic, recommendations included prophylactic therapeutic- or intermediate-dose heparin in hospitalized patients ( 54 ). Subsequent studies have not found benefit to this and, although current guidelines vary by society, they generally recommend standard-of-care therapy for hospitalized patients (ie, prophylactic heparin without contraindication and therapeutic heparin with high suspicion of venous thromboembolism) and no standard recommendation for prophylactic anticoagulation in outpatients ( 55 , 56 ). Interpretations and Descriptions of CT Findings at Long-term Follow-up For the accurate imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, several structured reporting systems have been proposed ( 57 59 ). However, these classification systems are focused on acute COVID-19 findings and lack descriptions or terminologies for post COVID-19 pneumonia. In 2022, a glossary of terms, including post COVID-19 pneumonia findings, was proposed by European societies ( 60 ) and included terms such as low-attenuation GGO and tinted sign to describe the resolving status of COVID-19 pneumonia. Low-attenuation GGO was defined as a progressive decrease in attenuation of GGO or consolidation during recovery, and tinted sign was defined as GGO extending farther into the lungs while decreasing in attenuation. The term post-COVID fibrosis has often been used in the literature for parenchymal abnormalities such as bronchiolectasis, reticulation, parenchymal bands, pleural thickening, and GGOs, but without appropriate pathologic confirmation or further follow-up. These findings are more likely to occur in patients who had more severe pneumonia at baseline ( 21 , 25 , 32 , 34 ). In the 2022 European glossary, fibrotic-like changes were defined as reticulations associated with bronchial dilatation and distortion in areas of consolidation or GGO. In reporting these findings, it should be emphasized that these changes are likely to resolve with time ( 32 ) ( Fig 6 ). Similarly, the term bronchial distortion should be used in preference to traction bronchiectasis because of this potential for reversibility ( 41 ). CT findings of multifocal reticular or cystic lesions on hospital discharge should be emphasized because these are more likely to be associated with persistent abnormality at 1-year follow-up ( 34 ). The CT finding of parenchymal bands is unlikely to represent clinically significant fibrosis ( 61 , 62 ). Figure 6: CT images show reversibility of bronchial dilatation and fibrotic-like changes in a 65-year-old man with a history of kidney transplant and persistent dyspnea. (A, B) Axial CT images obtained 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower lobe predominant mixed areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) in bilateral lungs. Note the bronchial dilatation (dashed circle) within the mixed areas of consolidation and GGO. (C, D) Axial CT images obtained 14 months after infection demonstrate residual low-attenuation GGO; however, no residual bronchial dilatation is observed. Figure 6: Download as PowerPoint Effect of Variants and Vaccines on Chronic Lung Injury after COVID-19 The effect of variants, vaccines, and repeat infections on chronic lung injury of COVID-19 are still largely unexplored. Because of the accumulation of genetic variants over time, distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2 have dominated at different stages of the pandemic, with varied transmissibility and pathogenicity. Although few direct comparisons have been made, a person s likelihood of acute and chronic lung involvement from COVID-19 seems to depend on the timing of infection. The current Omicron variant is less likely to infect the upper and lower respiratory tracts ( 63 ) compared with its predecessors, the Delta variant ( 64 ) and the Alpha variant ( 65 ), and leads to less severe lung disease, making comparison of prevalence studies of post-COVID lung disease challenging. Recent studies have also shown that COVID-19 pneumonia is becoming less common and less severe because of changes of variants and vaccinations ( 66 , 67 ), and these changes may lead to fewer residual abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia in the future. Histopathologic Characteristics of Persistent Lung Disease after COVID-19 Post COVID-19 histopathologic changes of the lungs have been well described. The pathologic features of mild and reversible COVID-19 pneumonia include an organizing pneumonia pattern, and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage followed by fibrosis or acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia ( Fig 7 ). Two previous reports have revealed the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage in chronic COVID-19 disease, showing a varying degree of fibrosis from early collagen deposition to pronounced interstitial collagen deposition ( 14 , 15 ). Lung transplant explants 2 4 months after severe COVID-19 pneumonia have shown diffuse interstitial fibrosis and microscopic honeycomb changes without hyaline membrane formation ( 16 , 17 ). Figure 7: Images in a 50-year-old man who underwent lung transplant 45 days after initial diagnosis of COVID-19. Explanted lungs showed immature pulmonary fibrosis. The patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for more than 20 days. (A, B) Axial CT images obtained 18 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 show patchy and wide areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation in bilateral lungs. (C, D) Follow-up CT images obtained 41 days after the diagnosis show diffuse and mixed areas of GGO and dense consolidation in both lungs. GGO contains reticulation and bronchial dilatation (arrows in C ); air bronchograms (arrowheads in C ) and cystic changes (dashed circle in D ) are also noted. (E G) Low-magnification photomicrographs (hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification, 4) of explanted lungs show total collapse of lung with early phase of fibrosis and fibroblasts (arrow in E ). There are also microscopic honeycomb cysts (arrows in F ) and barotrauma cysts (arrows in G ). Figure 7: Download as PowerPoint Recent studies provide new histopathologic insights for persistent lung disease after COVID-19 pneumonia. A study of surgical lung biopsies of 18 patients with persistent interstitial lung disease (ILD) following recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia showed that 50% of patients had a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern of fibrosis, the predominately fibrotic pathologic pattern seen in several chronic ILDs ( 68 ). Some of these patients may have had underlying ILDs preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study including 10 patients who underwent transbronchial lung cryobiopsy an average of 3.5 months after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia reported three different histopathologic clusters. Cluster 1 included patients ( n = 2) with CT and histologic evidence of fibrosis, thought to have postinfectious progression of preexisting ILD. Cluster 2 included patients ( n = 5) with CT evidence of organizing pneumonia and a range of histologic lung injuries, including organizing pneumonia, fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (a predominately inflammatory pattern seen in chronic ILD), and diffuse alveolar damage. Cluster 3 included patients ( n = 3) with CT findings of relatively mild GGO and histologic findings of vascular dilatation and perivascular fibrosis with otherwise normal lung parenchyma ( 18 ). This study observed that patients in each cluster showed different clinical symptoms and radiologic findings, suggesting potentially different underlying pathogenic mechanisms and thus a need for the use of differing therapeutic approaches. For instance, all patients from three clusters universally showed respiratory symptoms, but patients from cluster 1 had no systemic symptoms with low D lco , patients from cluster 2 showed systemic symptoms with low D lco, and those from cluster 3 showed systemic symptoms with normal D lco . Indeed, COVID-19 induced chronic lung disease is unlikely to be a single disease entity ( 18 ), and histopathologic correlation with imaging findings can play a role in timely diagnosis and optimal management. Alternatively, Diaz et al ( 69 ) reported that patients who underwent elective lung resection after complete recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia had no discernible histopathologic changes at a median 2-month follow-up, suggesting that persistent histopathologic changes may not occur in COVID-19 survivors without prolonged symptoms. Treatment of Post-COVID Lung Disease There are currently no established treatment guidelines for post-COVID lung disease. With the observation early in the pandemic of persistent radiographic abnormalities suggestive of organizing pneumonia, corticosteroids were initially reported to speed recovery in symptoms, imaging findings, and pulmonary function ( 70 ). Subsequent results from the larger studies found potential harm in the use of corticosteroids in hospitalized patients not receiving respiratory support ( 71 , 72 ) and have led to reluctance to use them in outpatients. The currently available antifibrotics, nintedanib and pirfenidone, were thought to have a role in the prevention of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis early in the pandemic ( 73 ), but only nintedanib is in an ongoing clinical trial for the prevention of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis ( clinicaltrials.gov no.: NCT04619680). Lung transplant remains a viable option for patients with severe post-COVID lung disease, and, although short-term outcomes are good, transplant in these complex patients remains challenging and requires careful patient selection ( 74 ). Emerging Imaging Techniques for Chronic COVID-19 Lung Injury Table 3 summarizes the emerging imaging techniques for evaluating patients with PCC, especially beyond anatomic or structural changes. A recently published prospective study by Prayer et al ( 75 ) used ultrahigh-resolution photon-counting detector CT to assess the lungs of patients with persisting symptoms after COVID-19 pneumonia. The study found that photon-counting detector CT images revealed additional subtle lung abnormalities, such as bronchiolectasis and fine reticulations, in 10 of 20 participants. These subtle abnormalities were not noted on the conventional energy-integrating detector CT scans ( Fig 8 ). This suggests that photon-counting detector CT images may enable the precise detection of residual lesions or early-stage fibrosis in patients with prolonged symptoms and help identify patients who may require additional treatment. Table 3: Summary of Studies on Emerging Imaging Techniques for Assessing Chronic Lung Injury Following COVID-19 Pneumonia Figure 8: Ultrahigh-resolution noncontrast axial CT lung scans in a 55-year-old man with persistent exertional dyspnea and chronic fatigue 399 days after COVID-19. Four sets of images were obtained: (A) a 1.0-mm image obtained with energy-integrating detector CT and (B) 1.0-mm, (C) 0.4-mm, and (D) 0.2-mm images obtained with photon-counting detector CT at the same level. Ground-glass opacities detected with energy-integrating detector CT (arrows in A ) were found to contain reticulations at photon-counting detector CT (arrows in B D ). Reprinted, with permission, from reference 75 . Figure 8: Download as PowerPoint A novel imaging technique, xenon 129 ( 129 Xe) MRI, also has shown promising results in detecting abnormalities of alveolar gas exchange, which are not apparent at conventional imaging ( 76 78 ). In a 2022 study by Grist et al ( 76 ), a reduced mean red blood cell to tissue plasma ratio was observed at 129 Xe MRI in patients with PCC compared with healthy volunteers, despite normal or near-normal appearance of the lung parenchyma at CT ( Fig 9 ). These findings suggest potential defects in the lung alveolar membrane or the surrounding blood vessels resulting in functional impairment beyond the structural changes detected at CT. Moreover, Matheson et al ( 78 ) demonstrated abnormal gas exchange at 129 Xe MR spectroscopy and reduced vascular density metrics at CT in patients with PCC, findings that were correlated with impaired D lco and dyspnea. This suggests that microangiopathy may be a pathologic mechanism contributing to PCC. In another study that used 129 Xe MRI to prospectively assess 53 patients with PCC, Kooner et al ( 77 ) showed that the percentage of ventilation defects assessed with this modality 3 months after COVID-19 were predictive of changes in the 6-minute walk distance 15 months after COVID-19. These studies elucidate the potential of 129 Xe MRI as a sensitive tool for recognizing and predicting clinical outcome of post-COVID fibrosis, as well as comprehending its mechanisms. Nonetheless, the number of enrolled patients is limited and, given the relatively nonspecific nature of the imaging findings not specific for COVID, further investigations are needed to delve into the intricate pathophysiologic aspects of post-COVID fibrosis. Figure 9: Example CT, proton (hydrogen 1 [ 1 H]), and proton and red blood cell to tissue plasma (RBC:TP) images in three participants with post COVID-19 condition (PCC). Top row: Images from 39-year-old man with a red blood cell to tissue plasma value of 0.49. Middle row: Images in a 61-year-old man with a red blood cell to tissue plasma value of 0.31. Bottom row: Images in a 46-year-old woman with a red blood cell to tissue plasma value of 0.24. Imaging revealed little to no discernible damage on CT scans yet highly heterogeneous and low red blood cell to tissue plasma in the lungs of nonhospitalized participants with PCC. The color bar indicates the red blood cell to tissue plasma ratio. Adapted, with permission, from reference 76 . Figure 9: Download as PowerPoint Low-field-strength MRI may also be useful for imaging patients with PCC. In 2023, Heiss et al ( 79 ) published a study of 54 pediatric patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were assessed using free-breathing phase-resolved pulmonary MRI at low field strength. They showed that ventilation-perfusion matching at low-field-strength MRI was reduced in participants after COVID-19 infection, including both the recovered group and a group with PCC, compared with noninfected healthy controls, up to 1 year after COVID-19 symptom onset. Another study ( 80 ) reported several parameters reflecting ventilation and perfusion, calculated from low-field-strength MRI, that could be used to assess pulmonary functional alterations and showed an association between these parameters and persistent symptoms after COVID-19. Although the mainstream pulmonary evaluation method in clinical routine is CT, MRI has potential advantages as a nonionizing technology capable of providing functional information without requiring breath holds or injection of exogenous contrast material. One longitudinal study ( 22 ) demonstrated that certain patients show persistent respiratory symptoms and impaired D lco despite normal chest CT scans, and lung MRI may provide additional information in this context. Advances in Artificial Intelligence in the Chronic COVID-19 Era Artificial intelligence has numerous potential applications in diagnostic imaging, including the detection and segmentation of lesions, facilitating diagnosis, guiding treatment, and improving prognostication. To date, various deep learning (DL) models have been introduced for diagnosis and risk stratification of COVID-19 pneumonia ( Table 4 ). Table 4: Summary of Studies on Development and Application of Deep Learning Models to COVID-19 Pneumonia During the early stages of the pandemic, DL models primarily focused on diagnosing COVID-19 using chest radiography or CT. Li et al ( 81 ) developed a DL model with use of nonenhanced chest CT to differentiate between COVID-19 pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia or other conditions. In that study, the median time from symptom onset to chest CT was 7 days (range, 0 20 days), and the algorithm achieved high sensitivity and specificity (90% and 96%, respectively) for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the independent test set. Wang et al ( 82 ) developed a DL model that can be used to triage febrile patients as having either COVID-19 pneumonia or another condition. They validated its performance in a large external validation set of 2120 patients, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.953 for detecting COVID-19 among febrile patients. Furthermore, the model reduced the time to diagnosis compared with radiologists, which is crucial during a pandemic. DL models have also been developed for prognostication and risk stratification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Wang et al ( 83 ) developed a DL system to stratify patients with COVID-19 into high- and low-risk groups based on chest CT scans from 709 patients. They demonstrated that hospital-stay time differed significantly between the two groups in two external validation sets. In another study, Wang et al ( 84 ) developed a DL model that integrated CT findings and clinical data of 1051 patients with COVID-19 to predict the length of time from hospital admission to critical illness. This model showed promising performance for predicting disease progression, with an AUC of 0.804. Similarly, Lassau et al ( 85 ) integrated CT data with five clinical and biologic variables (age, sex, oxygenation, serum urea level, and platelet count) and constructed a DL model using data from 646 patients with COVID-19. The model showed an AUC of 0.790 for predicting critically ill COVID-19 condition, such as the need for ventilation, high oxygen, or death. Artificial intelligence also has a wide range of clinical applications in PCC. One study ( 86 ) created a DL model from the electronic health records of more than 1.7 million patients, using various baseline clinical parameters, such as demographic characteristics, health care utilization, diagnosis, and medication, to identify potential PCC among patients with COVID-19. The model yielded strong performance for identifying patients with COVID-19 who would go on to develop PCC, achieving AUCs of 0.92 for all patients, 0.90 for hospitalized patients, and 0.85 for nonhospitalized patients ( 86 ). In another study ( 87 ), researchers developed an algorithm to classify patients with PCC (30 180 days after infection) into four clinical subphenotypes: (a) cardiac and renal symptoms; (b) respiratory, sleep, and anxiety symptoms; (c) musculoskeletal and nervous system symptoms; and (d) digestive and respiratory system sequelae. These were highly reproducible across two cohorts with distinct patient populations and geographical characteristics. This algorithm could potentially be used to guide optimal management for patients with PCC. In terms of radiologic features, Zhou et al ( 88 ) developed a DL model to optimize CT image window and level to identify subtle CT features of chronic COVID-19 lung injury that are either invisible or subtle with standard display settings. With the aid of a DL model, radiologists may find symptom-correlated interpretable but subtle CT features from patients with COVID-19 ( 88 ). With the increasing number of COVID-19 survivors, automated segmentation and quantification of CT findings for those with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 pneumonia will be extremely useful. Although we lack image analysis software specifically developed for chronic CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia, there are various commercially available DL-based segmentation tools for ILD and small airway disease ( 89 91 ). Adopting predeveloped artificial intelligence software for the evaluation of chronic lung disease after COVID-19 may enable more objective and quantitative interpretation of the CT features, including GGO, reticulation, bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolectasis, honeycombing, and air trapping ( Fig 10 ). Taken together, the growing body of literature suggests that the development and implementation of artificial intelligence powered technologies may enhance daily clinical practice and allow for effective workflow in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 10: Images demonstrate application of a deep-learning (DL) model for automatic segmentation and quantification of chronic lung parenchymal changes after COVID-19 pneumonia (aview Lung Texture; Coreline Soft). A 64-year-old man underwent chest CT for the evaluation of pulmonary sequela 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. He had no relevant symptoms. (A, C) Axial CT images show focal areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and reticulation in bilateral lungs. (B, D) Application of DL model developed for the segmentation and quantification of interstitial lung abnormality shows automatic segmentation and quantification of reticular opacity (orange, 2% of total lung volume) and GGO (yellow, 1% of total lung volume). Figure 10: Download as PowerPoint Conclusion A comprehensive understanding of the clinical, histologic, and radiologic aspects of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 is crucial. Imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation and management of these patients. Studies have indicated that a subset of patients continue to exhibit residual CT abnormalities, including ground-glass opacity, reticulation, and bronchiectasis, even 1 year after COVID-19 symptom onset. Furthermore, these abnormalities have been correlated with lung function impairment. The presence of chronic pulmonary embolism on pulmonary CT angiograms or perfusion abnormalities on dual-energy CT scans have also been observed and in some individuals may indicate a thrombogenic or microangiopathic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many factors can influence post COVID-19 condition (PCC), such as diverse COVID-19 variants, breakthrough and recurrent infections, co-infections, patients immune status, and vaccinations, all of which must be considered as we move forward ( 92 ). For instance, many predictive and risk stratification models based on DL have been developed for patients with PCC, and it is essential to validate their performance in various environments. In addition, novel imaging techniques can reveal chronic pathologic changes beyond an anatomic resolution. Imaging modalities, such as photon-counting detector CT, 129 Xe MRI, and low-field-strength MRI, have been used to detect subtle lung parenchymal abnormalities or functional impairment that conventional CT may not capture. However, the clinical application of these emerging techniques is still limited, and their diagnostic and prognostic performance must be further verified. Future studies will improve understanding of the long-term clinical, histologic, and radiologic effects of PCC decades after the initial infection. Disclosures of conflicts of interest: M.J.C.

Abstract Full Text References Cited by PDF Abstract Section: Choose Top of page Abstract << Methods Resuming Outpatient Clini... Specific Pulmonary and Sl... Conclusions References CITING ARTICLES Background: In March 2020, many elective medical services were canceled in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions. Methods: Volunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities. Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane. This will impact an institution s mitigation needs. Operating procedures should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed. The suggestions provided are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors or the American Thoracic Society. Keywords : COVID-19 ; SARS-CoV-2 ; pulmonary function tests ; bronchoscopy ; polysomnography ... Show All In March 2020, many elective medical services were canceled in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) were undertaken across the United States in an effort to reduce the number of cases and deaths and to prevent healthcare resources from being overwhelmed. By late April 2020, the daily COVID-19 case rate was declining in many states. The Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors (APCCSDD) discussed operational aspects of COVID-19 clinical care during a weekly webinar hosted by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) throughout the pandemic. Participants foresaw the need for guidance in resuming on-site activities for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions, and it was decided that a plan would be created on the basis of consensus. The plan is guided by the realization that as community physical-distancing practices are loosened, there is a risk of virus reintroduction; therefore, ambulatory clinics must make significant efforts to mitigate the risk of viral exposure to patients and to staff until the threat of COVID-19 has receded. The goals of the plan are to 1 ) protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus; 2 ) account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19; and 3 ) provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. The suggestions in this document should not be considered mandates. They are intended as a baseline from which institutions can develop their own plan, consistent with their unique circumstances. The suggestions are those of the authors and do not represent official positions of the APCCSDD or the ATS. Methods Section: Choose Top of page Abstract Methods << Resuming Outpatient Clini...

Conclusions References CITING ARTICLES The ATS Chief of Guidelines and Documents solicited volunteers from the APCCSDD to serve as group leaders and create plans for restoring normal operations in outpatient pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography (PSG) laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) facilities. Each group leader formed a working group to assist in creation of the plans. Completed plans from the individual working groups were collated into an overall plan and document. The draft was shared with all authors, who reviewed the document and provided feedback and edits. Several cycles of review and revision ensued until there was consensus that submission for peer review was warranted. The manuscript was revised to address peer-reviewer comments and then underwent several cycles of review and revision before being submitted for further consideration by the Journal .

Conclusions References CITING ARTICLES When to Resume The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recommend that the resumption of elective in-person services be considered only in states or regions that have satisfied the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gating criteria for reopening: 1 ) a downward trajectory of COVID-19 like cases and influenza-like illnesses over a 14-day period, 2 ) hospitals having capability to treat all patients without crisis care, 3 ) a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, and 4 ) a downward trajectory of confirmed cases over a 14-day period or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percentage of total tests over a 14-day period ( 1 , 2 ). The recommendation for a downward trajectory of confirmed cases assumes that the volume of testing remains relatively constant; otherwise, variation in the daily case rate may reflect changes in testing volume rather than the infection rate. For this reason, it is important that an adequate volume of testing be achieved before determining the 14-day trajectory of the case rate, as increasing the testing volume while using the case rate for decision-making may be misleading. It can be difficult to determine the trajectory of the case rate over 14 days if there is large day-to-day variation. In this situation, alternative approaches include 1 ) calculating the mean case rate over the previous 7 days and using a decrease in this measure for 14 consecutive days as indicative of a downward trajectory of the case rate or 2 ) using the COVID-19 hospital admission rate as a surrogate for the case rate ( Figure 1 ). The latter has the added advantage of being less dependent on testing volume. For communities in which the case rate is already low, 14 consecutive days with a consistently low case rate is sufficient to resume elective in-person clinical visits, as long as the case rate is not trending upward. Figure 1. Assessment of the local new case rate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend a downward trajectory in the new case rate for 14 days before resuming elective medical services. ( A ) The trajectory of the new case rate can be variable from day-to-day. ( B ) Using the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization rate as a surrogate provides less day-to-day variability and is less dependent on testing volume. ( C ) The mean new case rate over the preceding 7 days (red line) also provides less day-to-day variability. Download Figure | Download Powerpoint [More] [Minimize] In addition to a downward trajectory or consistently low case rate, to resume elective clinical services, an institution should have the capacity to implement all of the operational strategies described below: patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. Patient Prioritization Safely restoring outpatient pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinical services requires the prioritization of patients needs. During the period in which elective medical services were cancelled or reduced, many patients did not receive usual care, and a backlog developed; ideally, the resumption of in-person visits should be prioritized for the patients who need them most. The CMS Non-Emergent, Elective Medical Services, and Treatment Recommendations classify ambulatory services into tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 on the basis of the acuity and urgency of the requested services ( 3 ). Tier 1 visits involve low-acuity services for routine specialty care, screening, preventive care, or supervised rehabilitative-therapy services. Tier 2 visits involve intermediate acuity services for established patients with new symptoms or for new patients with nonurgent symptoms. Tier 3 high-acuity services are for new patients with new symptoms or for any patient with severe symptoms ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Framework for the prioritization of elective medical services on the basis of acuity. COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019. Download Figure | Download Powerpoint [More] [Minimize] This framework prioritizes outpatient services on the basis of acuity and can be tailored to institutional resources, patient and provider preferences, and community disease prevalence: Institutional resources. Pertinent institutional resources include space, staff, and personal protective equipment (PPE). If any of these resources are in short supply, an institution may choose to resume services with fewer in-person visits than if those resources were abundant. As an example, an institution may decide to open at half-capacity because of a shortage of PPE and, therefore, may accommodate only tier 3 patients, whereas it might have opened to both tier 2 and tier 3 patients had there not been a shortage of PPE. Provider and patient preferences. Tier 2 visits in the CMS framework incorporate provider and patient discretion. For example, providers who routinely see highly specialized pulmonary or sleep problems may be comfortable with video visits in situations in which another provider less familiar with the subspecialty problem may wish to see patients in person. Factors that may influence patient preferences include access to and familiarity with telehealth resources, balanced against the burden and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure associated with in-person visits. Community disease prevalence. In regions with a low prevalence of COVID-19, less restrictive mitigation strategies may be appropriate. For example, tier 2 patients can be accommodated by either telehealth or in-person visits; in the context of high disease prevalence, a telehealth appointment may be preferable, whereas in the context of low disease prevalence, an in-person visit may be preferable. Screening and Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and removal of such patients from the normal flow of patient care as early as possible are essential components of an effective strategy to resume clinical operations and ensure the safety of other patients and staff. All patients scheduled for outpatient services should undergo screening for high-risk exposures, fever, and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (i.e., cough, dyspnea, myalgias, anosmia, and/or dysgeusia) ( 4 ). This will ideally be done in two phases. The first phase of screening should ideally occur within 72 hours of the scheduled appointment, and no more than 7 days before the scheduled appointment, by reaching out to patients by telephone or e-mail or providing access to online check-in and screening. During the screening, patients should also be advised on institutional policies for people accompanying them to their clinic appointment, and anyone accompanying them should also be screened. Patients who are detected by screening as having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing, ideally within 48 hours of the scheduled visit. Testing is particularly important in patients with pulmonary disease because many patients have chronic and/or acute symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from COVID-19. The second phase of screening should occur upon arrival for their appointment (or they should undergo initial screening if they could not be reached for advanced screening) and, like the first phase, should consist of questioning about exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, fever, and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Temperature checks upon arrival are appropriate if resources permit. Facilities should take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission by using separate spaces or buildings for care of patients with acute COVID-19 and by implementing mitigation procedures in areas used for non COVID-19 patient care. On the basis of the results of screening plus testing, the following approaches are recommended: No symptoms during initial screening and upon arrival, or SARS-CoV-2-negative test and no symptoms upon arrival. The patient may proceed to an area dedicated for low-risk patients to wait for their appointment. SARS-CoV-2 negative test results but new symptoms upon arrival or SARS-CoV-2 status unknown (never tested) but new symptoms upon arrival. The patient should be directed to a dedicated waiting area for high-risk patients, where they can undergo diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, or they should be sent home to quarantine until testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed. If the test results for SARS-CoV-2 are negative and concern for COVID-19 persists (i.e., an alternative cause of symptoms has not been identified), a second test may be performed to minimize the chance of being misled by an initial false-negative result. SARS-CoV-2 positive test result. If appropriate, the patient should be sent home to quarantine and should contact their primary care provider regarding next steps. Their appointment may be done by telehealth while in quarantine or rescheduled to a later date. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with acute symptoms requiring urgent evaluation should be masked and accompanied to the closest emergency department or urgent-care COVID-19 evaluation unit by personnel wearing PPE. The decision about when to reschedule patients with COVID-19 for elective in-person visits may be extrapolated from the CDC s guidance on when infected healthcare workers may return to work ( 5 ). Patients identified as having COVID-19 may be rescheduled for elective in-person clinical services when one of the following three situations exists: 1 ) they lack fever (i.e., temperature < 100 F) without fever-reducing medications, their respiratory symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnea) have improved, and they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart; 2 ) they have been free from fever without fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours, their symptoms have improved, and at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their symptoms first appeared; or 3 ) if asymptomatic, they have either tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart or at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The requirement for two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart is intended to minimize false-negative test results. The alternative requirement of 10 days from a positive test result or the onset of symptoms is based on limited evidence about the duration that viable virus is shed ( 6 ). Physical Distancing Physical distancing will remain a key approach to minimizing the recurrence of viral transmission as healthcare centers reopen, so institutions should employ strategies that facilitate physical distancing. There are numerous distancing strategies, and the higher the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, the more strategies will be warranted. Nonpatient visitors may be restricted or prohibited. Patients may be asked to wait outside until contacted on their cell phone to come into the clinic. Fewer patients may be scheduled per day and their appointments may be spaced out to minimize the density of people in the buildings, waiting areas, and clinical areas. Waiting areas may be reconfigured to ensure that there is a minimum of 6 feet between patients (does not require physical separation between a patient and an individual accompanying the patient). Limits may be placed on the number of individuals allowed in an elevator. Patients who are able may be encouraged to use stairs instead of an elevator. Unidirectional patient flow may be designed (check in at one point, go to clinic room, then check out at another point). Similarly, hallways and stairwells may be designated for unidirectional flow. Infection Control and PPE Patients who are not wearing a surgical mask or suitable face covering when they arrive should be provided a surgical mask and asked to don the mask upon entry into the building. Examination rooms should be cleaned between patients. Only essential medical contact should occur (i.e., between the provider and the patient only). Other communication, such as scheduling follow-up appointments and tests, should be done electronically, either at the time of the visit or via subsequent telephone or e-mail contact with the patient. Healthcare workers should wear a surgical mask throughout the medical facility for the entire duration of their shift. Additional protective equipment should be worn when interacting with patients, with the specific PPE depending on the risk of aerosolization. For example, healthcare workers may wear surgical masks while interviewing patients and then upgrade to surgical masks, gloves, and gowns during physical examinations, with face shields added for cough maneuvers and examinations of the nose and mouth. Vigilant PPE practices should be maintained for an extended duration, given the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19. Follow-Up Surveillance The patient should be instructed to contact the clinic if they develop new respiratory symptoms within 14 days of their visit and/or if COVID-19 is diagnosed. If human resources permit, institutions should reach out to patients roughly 2 weeks after their clinical service and assess if they remain symptom free, have developed symptoms of COVID-19, have undergone SARS-CoV-2 testing, and, if they have been tested, whether the results were positive or negative. Patients reporting new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who have not been tested should be instructed to quarantine and should be referred for diagnostic testing. Those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to the local health department for contact tracing if such public health services are available. For those who test negative, if concern for COVID-19 remains (i.e., symptoms cannot be attributed to another cause), repeat testing may be performed 24 hours later to minimize the risk of false-negative results. Assessment of Operational Success The success, or lack thereof, of resuming pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinical services should be critically appraised periodically. Operational success can be defined as the absence of viral transmission, ability to handle the patient volume without exceeding social-distancing constraints, and lack of delays in patient flow resulting in bottlenecks. Assessment should be iterative, with the goal of gradually increasing the percentage of in-person visits. If surveillance finds no viral transmission within the institution and the community daily case rate remains low, clinical services may be increased; however, if surveillance reveals viral transmission within the institution or the community daily case rate has increased, operating procedures should be reassessed. Before closing elective in-person clinical services, operations decision-makers should consider the potential adverse consequences of reclosure on patients and whether additional mitigation procedures are possible. Staff Considerations Staff should receive either COVID-19 or non COVID-19 assignments and should not rotate through both clinical settings. They should be trained on the appropriate PPE for various tasks. Staff should also be screened for symptoms daily, and those who develop symptoms should be sent home, quarantined, and tested for SARS-CoV-2. For staff with confirmed COVID-19, a test-based strategy may be used to determine when they can return to work if sufficient resources exist; otherwise, a non test-based strategy should be followed. If a test-based strategy is used, staff may return to work once they lack fever (i.e., temperature < 100 F) without fever-reducing medications, have improvement of their symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnea), and test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart. Staff who are asymptomatic may return once they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart ( 5 ). If a non test-based strategy is used, staff may return to work once they have been free from fever without fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours, they have improvement of their symptoms, and at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) have passed since their symptoms first appeared. Staff who are asymptomatic should wait at least 10 days (or 10 to 20 days for patients with severe COVID-19 or who are severely immunocompromised) from their first test positive for SARS-CoV-2 before returning to work ( 5 ). The choice between a test-based strategy and a non test-based strategy depends on institutional resources and preferences, as neither strategy is infallible. Testing may yield false-negative results, providing false reassurance and allowing an infectious healthcare worker to return to work. It may also detect prolonged shedding of inactive (rather than active) viral particles, delaying the healthcare worker s return to work. A non test-based strategy relies on scarce, early data regarding the duration of shedding of viable virus that has not been rigorously confirmed. Reports of outbreaks after the return of symptomatically recovered patients with COVID-19 to their living facilities suggest that a cautious approach is prudent (i.e., testing for SARS-CoV-2 from two consecutive specimens collected 24 hours apart to minimize false-negative results), especially for healthcare workers in high-risk settings like nursing homes and healthcare workers who care for patients who are immunocompromised. Because information about the relationship between testing results and infectivity risk is evolving, institutional guidance may change and should be followed. Specific Pulmonary and Sleep-Medicine Services Section: Choose Top of page Abstract Methods Resuming Outpatient Clini... Specific Pulmonary and Sl... << Conclusions References CITING ARTICLES Pulmonary Function Testing PFT presents unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. PFTs may result in high aerosol generation, which can spread droplets from an infected individual even if they are asymptomatic. Cross-contamination of equipment, testing rooms, waiting areas, and corridors may result in viral transmission to staff and other patients, which is particularly problematic for vulnerable patients. Therefore, some institutions may prefer a strategy of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients who are scheduled to undergo PFTs within 72 hours of their appointment, in contrast to the approach described above, in which patients are tested for SARS-CoV-2 if they are found during screening to have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The final strategy depends on institutional preferences, resources, and local prevalence. It is important to be mindful of the risks versus benefits for every patient scheduled to undergo PFTs and for every procedure. In other words, how important is the lung-function test for making a diagnosis and/or decision relative to the risk of exposing staff and cross-contaminating equipment? Examples of situations that might favor performing PFTs include the evaluation of lung-transplant and lung-resection candidacy, assessment of the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung or bone-marrow transplant recipients, diagnostic evaluation of patients with significant unexplained or complex dyspnea, and guidance of clinical decisions in patients with chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. Once it has been determined that PFTs are indicated, the specific test must be considered because tests have varying risk of aerosolization and viral transmission (e.g., methacholine-challenge testing, exercise-challenge testing, and cardiopulmonary-exercise testing are higher risk than spirometry, 6-minute walk test, and measurement of lung volumes or diffusion capacity). Only tests deemed essential should be performed. In most situations, this will include spirometry with or without diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. If bronchodilator testing must be performed, use of a metered dose inhaler is preferable to a nebulizer to minimize aerosol exposure. If a nebulizer must be used, a breath-actuated nebulizer is likely lower risk than a regular nebulizer. A viral/bacterial filter can be attached to the side of some nebulizers to capture the exhaled aerosol particles and limit the amount of potentially infectious aerosol that enters the room during the treatment. It is less common that lung volumes will be essential, but use of body plethysmography units might be preferable because of containment of exhaled air. Exercise testing and bronchial-challenge procedures should be postponed if possible because of their particularly high risk of high aerosol production due to high minute ventilation or coughing. For patients who need ongoing surveillance of pulmonary function, home spirometry is a reasonable option with enhanced coaching and education by video and telemedicine. However, clinicians should be aware that the results from home spirometry may be less reliable because of quality issues. During the PFTs, appropriate precautions must be followed. For high-risk patients (e.g., those from a high-prevalence community) or high-risk aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., bronchial-challenge testing), the PFTs should be performed in a negative-pressure room, if available and as per local policy. Patients should be instructed in cough etiquette and wear a surgical mask as much as possible to avoid aerosol dispersion, and the staff should wear appropriate PPE (N95 mask, face shield, gown, and gloves). Both patients and staff should maintain a safe distance from one another and wash their hands before and after testing. Only necessary PFT equipment should be kept within the laboratory. In-line antibacterial and antiviral filters should be used, and equipment should be disinfected according to the manufacturer s instructions. The room should be disinfected between patients, and physical distancing should be practiced in common areas ( 7 ). Sufficient time should be allotted between patients to allow adequate room ventilation; the exact amount of time will vary depending on whether the room is under negative pressure and whether there is concomitant use of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or ultraviolet-light decontamination ( 8 ). The same precautions should be taken if the PFTs are performed in the context of research. Bronchoscopy and Procedure Suites When an institution is ready to resume outpatient clinical activities, the backlog that developed during the suspension of elective services should be addressed by prioritizing the procedures according to urgency. A priori ty scoring system (the Medically Necessary and Time-Sensitive instrument) was developed to assist with the prioritization of procedures ( 9 ). An example of a high-priority elective procedure is a lung mass with lymphadenopathy for diagnosis and staging, whereas a lower-priority elective procedure is surveillance of a stent or transplant or surveillance of tracheostomy changes ( 10 ). There is no empirical evidence regarding the necessity of preprocedural testing for SARS-CoV-2. Many institutions perform preprocedural testing on all patients because of the high prevalence of asymptotic COVID-19 infections coupled with the high risk of viral transmission due to aerosolization during bronchoscopy and similar procedures. Any patient who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 and does not have an urgent need for the procedure should have their procedure deferred. The procedure should not be rescheduled until the patient meets one of the three criteria described above for rescheduling elective in-person clinical services. The procedure schedule should allot more time per patient than usual, so there are fewer patients and staff in the suite at any given time. In the waiting, preprocedural, and recovery areas, patients and staff should wear surgical masks, and physical distancing should be respected. Bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy are superspreading procedures that confer a particularly high risk of viral transmission. Such procedures should be performed in a negative-pressure room. The minimal number of necessary providers should participate in a procedure, and they should be vigilant in donning and doffing PPE, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown, gloves, hat, and shoe covers. Patients should ideally recover in a negative-pressure room. Lower-risk procedures, such as pleural procedures, may be performed outside of a negative-pressure environment if a HEPA filter is available. Staff should wear a surgical mask, face shield, gown, and gloves. Only necessary testing equipment should be kept within the procedure suite. Cleaning and decontamination should be done between procedures. This includes a standard disinfection protocol for durable, reusable video monitors and standard high-level disinfection of reusable bronchoscopes ( 11 ). Patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive and must have a procedure performed should have their procedure performed at the end of the workday so that the room may be terminally cleaned after the procedure. Full PPE should be used, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown, gloves, head covering, and shoe covers. PSG Laboratories PSG services should resume in a phased manner to allow for staff acclimation to new workflows. The first phase should involve home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) as a preferred diagnostic test for obstructive sleep apnea (this can also be deployed during an ongoing COVID-19 emergency if resources are available). Mail delivery of devices to and from the patient s home is encouraged. Use of disposable HSAT equipment, if available, can also be considered. Upon receipt by mail, the bagged device should be isolated for 72 hours and then cleaned and disinfected with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered product recommended by the manufacturer ( 12 , 13 ). Concurrent initiation of in-laboratory PSG overnight testing might be considered by some laboratories where the prevalence of COVID-19 remains low and staff are appropriately trained and comfortable with local infection-control policies. The next phase is the initiation of in-laboratory diagnostic PSG without positive-airway-pressure (PAP) titration. Testing should begin at 50% capacity to facilitate physical distancing between technologists in the control room and allow for acclimation to the new workflows and increased use of PPE. This service could be ramped up as these concerns are adequately overcome. Patients who are at high risk for adverse outcomes should be prioritized. This includes patients with significant sleepiness (e.g., due to narcolepsy), safety concerns (e.g., rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder), or comorbid conditions that raise concerns for central sleep apnea and/or hypoventilation syndromes (e.g., congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, morbid obesity), which should be assessed by attended PSG. For each patient, the benefits of in-laboratory testing should be weighed against the potential risk of developing COVID-19 related illness (e.g., for older adults, pregnant women, and those with serious medical conditions) before deciding on in-laboratory PSG ( 14 ). The multiple-sleep-latency test/maintenance-of-wakefulness test should follow guidelines similar to those for in-laboratory PSG. Mattresses should have plastic covers that can be cleaned and disinfected with an EPA-registered disinfectant ( 12 , 13 ). All room surfaces should also be cleaned and disinfected between patients, and the same disinfectants should be used ( 15 ). Children are more likely to have asymptomatic cases; therefore, testing for SARS-CoV-2 48 hours before the sleep study should be considered in high-prevalence areas. Use of PPE by staff conducting pediatric testing should be strongly considered. Because most pediatric and even some adult sleep studies require a family member to stay overnight, any family member that comes to the sleep center should undergo similar testing for COVID-19 before being allowed to stay at the sleep center, and if they test negative, they may stay in the room with the patient. The final phase of restoring sleep services consists of the strategic introduction of PAP titrations, which are associated with an increased aerosolization risk. During PAP titration, the technologist should wear appropriate PPE equipment (N95 mask, face shield, gown, and gloves) and should be assigned one patient per night to mitigate risk of transmission. Portable HEPA filter units in the rooms should also be considered. If available, use of nonvented masks with a disposable expiratory port and attached HEPA filter may further reduce the risk of aerosolization ( 16 ). If PAP titrations cannot be performed, patients can be initiated on automatic continuous PAP (auto-CPAP) units on the basis of HSAT or PSG results and followed closely with remote monitoring of PAP data. Alternatively, during the COVID-19 public emergency, patients can be initiated on auto-PAP without a diagnostic sleep study, on the basis of clinician judgment and payer coverage policies. Pulmonary Rehabilitation PR is standard care for patients with chronic respiratory disease and continued symptoms and/or functional limitations despite otherwise maximal medical therapy. It is typically delivered as a group program with shared exercise equipment and group learning. This format has not been feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infection-control policies. Home PR alternatives to center-based PR have not been extensively studied, but several remotely delivered PR models are available with some published evidence of their efficacy ( 17 19 ). If remote PR is used, it should deliver the essential components of PR, which include exercise training, education, and behavior change. There appears to be a great need for rehabilitative services for those with post COVID-19 cardiopulmonary impairment and musculoskeletal compromise after critical illness. In this population, consideration should be given to acute rehabilitation during hospitalization once patients are hemodynamically stable and within the context of infectious-control policies and protocols. Routine rehabilitative services in COVID-19 survivors should be considered when patients are no longer contagious to address any unmet rehabilitation needs. Assessment should include measurements of physiological limitations (e.g., lung function, exercise and functional capacity, muscle function, balance) as well as patient-centered outcomes (e.g., symptoms and health-related quality of life). Collection of data regarding the outcomes of rehabilitative interventions will be necessary to inform future decision-making regarding rehabilitative interventions for survivors of COVID-19. From a logistical standpoint, before each PR session, patients should undergo the same screening and SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy described above for elective in-person services. Throughout each session, healthcare workers and patients should maintain social distancing. A surgical mask should be worn during the educational and behavioral-change portions of the session, and healthcare workers should change to an N95 mask, gloves, and gown during the exercise-training portion because of the risk of aerosolization during exercise. Only necessary equipment with adequate spacing should be kept in the training area, which should be thoroughly decontaminated after each session.

Conclusions << References CITING ARTICLES Elective medical services were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation strategies, such as physical distancing, were undertaken to reduce the number of cases and deaths and to prevent healthcare resources from being overwhelmed. The suspension of elective clinical services cannot be indefinite because patients health needs must be addressed. The CDC and CMS both indicate the resumption of clinical services can be considered once there is a 14-day downward trajectory of new cases, assuming that institutions have an operational strategy for the mitigation of viral transmission within the healthcare facility. Such a plan should consist of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. Importantly, a static plan is unlikely to remain maximally effective in the context of a dynamic process like SARS-CoV-2 transmission; therefore, the operational strategy should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed to emphasize strengths and correct faults.

Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines, there was a significant decrease in the incidence and mortality rates of this disease. However, the year 2022 witnessed a marked resurgence in cases worldwide, highlighting a major public health concern. This epidemiological shift emphasizes the urgent need for global health strategies to effectively manage and mitigate the evolving dynamics of pertussis. Data from 2008 to 2016 show stable pertussis cases in China, with annual counts ranging from 1612 to 6658. A sharp increase occurred from 2017 to 2019, with cases rising from 10,390 to 30,027. After a drop to 4475 in 2020, cases rebounded to 9611 in 2021 and surged beyond 38,000 in 2022 and 2023. Alarmingly, by early 2024, cases had already topped 32,000, # indicating a concerning trend that demands vigilant monitoring and proactive public health measures. Pertussis incidence fluctuations are linked to changes in epidemic prevention measures, with global patterns reflecting this trend. Fig. 1 depicts trends in pertussis cases reported per 100,000 people in China, US, UK, and Australia. In the U.S., cases peaked at 48,277 in 2012, then declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a notable decrease to 6124 in 2020, before rising again post-pandemic to 5611 in 2023. # The UK and Australia showed similar trends, with initial declines during the pandemic followed by recent increases, suggesting a rebound effect as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. For instance, UK cases surged from 69 in 2022 to 1468 in early 2024, # while Australia saw an increase to 2910 cases in early 2024. # These changes underscore the complex interplay between public health interventions, vaccination uptake, immune durability, and pathogen evolution in influencing pertussis spread. Fig. 1. Trends in Pertussis cases reported per 100,000 people in China, US, UK, and Australia. Data were collected from government official website. # (0.19MB). The rise in global pertussis cases has multiple causes. Waning immunity from acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines diminishes after 2 3 years, 1 3 leading to periodic spikes in cases. Stringent COVID-19 health measures temporarily reduced transmission, but their relaxation, such as lifting mask mandates, may have led to an immunity debt , 4 fueling a resurgence. Moreover, pathogen evolution has resulted in acellular vaccine antigens changing more rapidly than other proteins, 5 influencing outbreaks. Despite high Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP3) vaccination rates among one-year-olds, maintained across China, Australia, the U.S., and the U.K. from 2008 to 2022, with China achieving a 99 % rate since 2009 ( Fig. 2 ), the current outbreak may be tied to reduced vaccine efficacy and B. pertussis mutations. The complexities of diagnosing pertussis, due to subtle vaccine-modified symptoms and testing limitations, necessitate refined clinical and lab coordination. 6 Enhanced pertussis surveillance has led to better case detection, underscoring the need for continuous adaptation in public health strategies. Fig. 2. The coverage (%) of the Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP3) vaccine among one-year-olds, from 2008 to 2022, in China, US, UK and Australia. Data were collected from the WHO website. # (0.16MB). The global increase in pertussis cases highlights the critical need for focused international response and preparedness. To prevent more severe outbreaks, it's crucial for countries to rapidly improve their diagnostic and preventive measures. On December 4, 2023, China's National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine jointly updated the Pertussis Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol (2023 Edition) , # a comprehensive medical guide covering all aspects of pertussis management from etiology to prevention. While this protocol is set to significantly impact China's approach to pertussis, the lack of similar targeted policies in other countries amidst rising global cases is a major concern. In response to the global resurgence of pertussis, our strategy includes a national vaccination program targeting newborns, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, with emphasis on vaccinating pregnant women between 27 and 36 weeks to maximize maternal antibody transfer. We plan to enhance surveillance systems for prompt case detection and intervention, boost public awareness through media and community initiatives, and conduct regular health screenings in schools and nursing homes. Training healthcare providers in the latest diagnostic techniques, such as bacterial cultures early in symptom onset and PCR testing within three to four weeks, is vital for accurate diagnosis. We also aim to establish health education stations in busy public areas to promote healthy lifestyles and reduce pertussis transmission. As policy implementation progresses, a marked decline in pertussis incidence is anticipated, reducing its global impact. A 2020 study demonstrated China's success through pertussis vaccination, preventing over 100 million cases and saving around 370,000 children's lives from 1978 to 2017. 7 However, the global eradication of pertussis remains a formidable challenge. Increasing vaccine coverage, especially in underdeveloped regions, and addressing health education, economic barriers, and vaccine hesitancy are crucial. Governments must focus resources on underserved areas, ensuring vaccinations for high-risk groups and combating vaccine hesitancy. With the rise in antibiotic resistance, developing more effective treatments is vital. Consequently, global efforts must focus on crafting and implementing comprehensive strategies to eradicate pertussis.

This trend has attracted significant attention by the World Health Organization due to its potential implications for public health. 2 The China Influenza Surveillance Weekly Report has noted a significant increase in the Influenza-Like Illness percentage (ILI%) among sentinel hospitals in the northern provinces. Current figures indicate an ILI% of 7.4%, a marked increase from the 2.5%, 3.0%, and 2.0% reported during the same period in the years 2020-2022, respectively. 3 Globally, the annual incidence rate of influenza among children typically ranges from 20% to 30%. 4 During the 2017-2018 influenza season, recorded incidence rates for children aged 0-4 and 5-14 in Beijing were 18.7% 5 and 21.7%, 6 respectively. Notably, the past month has seen a dramatic rise in the detection rate of the influenza virus among children aged 0-14 in Beijing's medical institutions, now exceeding 48%. Additionally, the outpatient volume for respiratory infections has tripled in comparison to the previous year, with over 90% of these cases being cluster infections within educational and childcare settings. In recent times, China is encountering an increasingly intricate scenario in respiratory illnesses, characterized by a predominant disease co-existing with multiple infections. The National Institute of Respiratory Diseases' latest data indicates a shift in the dominant influenza strain this season. Notably, the A(H3N2) subtype's prevalence has risen substantially compared to the previous two years. 1 The National Influenza Center's surveillance report highlights that in March, influenza viruses emerged as the primary pathogens, showing a positive detection rate of 55%. By May 2023, COVID-19 s positivity rate peaked at 40%, then decreased to 19% by August 2023, while influenza rates stood at 2.7%. December 2023 s data reveals a continued upward trend in influenza virus detection across southern and northern provinces, at 12.7%, with COVID-19 cases accounting for 4%. Remarkably, Mycoplasma infections constitute 20%-30% of respiratory infections in children. 3 In certain pediatric hospitals, over 80% of pneumonia cases in children test positive for Mycoplasma, and 30-40% of these are mixed infections, predominantly involving Mycoplasma pneumoniae combined with influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus. Such mixed infections notably exacerbate the risk of adverse outcomes in children. A UK study involving 6,965 COVID-19 patients undergoing multi-pathogen respiratory testing revealed that hospitalized individuals with co-infections had a significantly higher likelihood of requiring mechanical ventilation (increased risk by 4.14 times, 95% CI: 2.00-8.49) and experiencing in-hospital mortality (increased risk by 2.35 times, 95% CI: 1.07-5.12). Additionally, the risk of severe clinical manifestations in children, such as high fever seizures, respiratory failure, and myocardial injury, also saw a significant rise. 7 The recent upsurge in respiratory infections among children in Northern China can be attributed to a complex interplay of factors, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . These include: 1. Viral Mutation : The influenza virus is known for its high variability, with frequent mutations potentially reducing the effectiveness of immunity acquired from previous strains. This constant evolution plays a crucial role in the fluctuating incidence rates. 2. Changes in Immunity : The strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, have markedly reduced young children's exposure to respiratory pathogens. This decreased exposure may have hindered the development of mucosal immunity in their respiratory tracts, thus creating a vulnerable 'immunity gap' population and heightening susceptibility among children. 8 3. Vaccination Status: In China, the influenza vaccination rate remains low due to factors such as limited public awareness, inadequate vaccine supply, a narrow range of vaccine options, and restricted coverage of free vaccination policies. The average annual influenza vaccination rate is about 2% to 3% for the general population, and approximately 26% for children aged 5 years and below. 9 This rate is substantially lower than those observed in developed countries. 4. Changes in Social Behavior : The easing of social restrictions and the reopening of schools have led to an increase in children's social interactions, potentially facilitating a higher transmission rate of respiratory diseases. 5. Environmental and Seasonal Factors : Recent data from the China Meteorological Administration highlight an increase in extreme weather events, including eight instances of sandstorms since June 2023, the highest in the past decade. 10 Such conditions, coupled with children's less developed immune systems and lower adaptability to climatic changes, increase their vulnerability to bacterial invasion and infection. These hypotheses, while providing a multifaceted perspective on the rising trend, also underscore the complexity of addressing respiratory infections in a post-pandemic era. Fig. 1. Factors contributing to the escalating trend of respiratory infections in children in Northern China. (0.36MB). In response to the rising epidemic of mixed infections in children, the Chinese government has implemented several innovative measures for epidemic prevention, focusing on enhancing healthcare services. A key initiative is the integration of big data and intelligent systems in hospitals, which has revolutionized medical service capabilities. This includes providing continuous access to vital information about fever clinics, essential for managing respiratory infections. A standout feature of this technological advancement is the real-time hospital registration monitoring system. Patients now can see current wait times and the number of people ahead of them in line, significantly improving pre-triage processes. This functionality not only streamlines patient flow but also reduces waiting times, enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery. In addition, the healthcare system has broadened its offerings to encompass online consultations and prescription services. In an innovative move, medications are now delivered directly to patients' homes by third-party entities, at no extra cost. This shift from traditional in-person medical services to a digital format is crucial in reducing the risk of pathogen transmission in hospital environments, thereby markedly decreasing the potential for cross-infection. These measures mark a strategic transformation in healthcare delivery, aiming to provide effective medical care while simultaneously controlling the spread of infections in a post-pandemic landscape. The advent of new infectious diseases, particularly acute respiratory infections, has highlighted the critical need for a robust and responsive public health emergency management system in China. This situation urgently calls for the development of a comprehensive early warning and monitoring system, specifically designed for acute respiratory infectious diseases. A key focus in addressing the mixed infection epidemic among children is the investigation into drug resistance mutations of the involved pathogens. Understanding their susceptibility or resistance to current antiviral drugs is crucial for devising effective treatment strategies. Concurrently, the expansion of influenza vaccination programs is paramount, especially for high-risk groups like children and the elderly. Enhancing vaccination coverage is imperative to reduce the risks of hospitalization and mortality in the event of influenza outbreaks. Additionally, the timely and transparent sharing of infection data with the public is essential. This should be accompanied by the distribution of scientifically sound information to promote public understanding and prevent unnecessary panic. Implementing such measures is vital not only for immediate control of the epidemic but also for establishing a resilient public health infrastructure capable of confronting future challenges. The observation of post-pandemic immunity gaps in both the USA and UK underscores the global nature of this challenge. 11 China's response to post-pandemic respiratory infections in children has been exemplary, demonstrating the effectiveness of a proactive and integrated public health strategy. This approach is characterized by the strategic use of technology, including big data and intelligent systems, to bolster healthcare delivery and disease surveillance. Furthermore, prioritizing the expansion of vaccination efforts, particularly among vulnerable populations, and establishing comprehensive early warning systems for infectious diseases emerge as pivotal measures. Enhanced international collaboration, through the exchange of data, experiences, and control strategies, is essential. Such cooperation fosters a global network capable of leveraging technological and policy innovations to effectively counter the threat of emerging infectious diseases.

Stanley Kubrik, director: 2001: A space odissey.1968 There is an increasing submission rate of manuscripts supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. While most journals require the declaration of such use, especially young researchers should be aware of potentials and limits of any innovation in scientific research. We therefore below report the following paragraphs (in italics ) including the answer to a question posed to ChatGPT itself. Artificial intelligence, including models like ChatGPT, has the potential to dramatically change scientific publishing in several ways: 1) Automated Literature Review: AI tools can efficiently scan and summarize vast amounts of existing literature on a given topic. This capability streamlines the process of conducting literature reviews, enabling researchers to stay abreast of the latest research findings more effectively and saving time in the initial stages of research. 2) Language Editing and Proofreading: AI-driven language models can assist authors in improving the clarity, coherence, and grammar of their manuscripts. They can provide real-time suggestions for sentence restructuring, word choice, and grammatical corrections, thereby enhancing the quality of scientific writing and reducing the need for extensive manual editing. 3) Data Analysis and Interpretation: Algorithms can analyse complex datasets more quickly and accurately than humans, facilitating the interpretation of experimental results and the generation of insights. This capability can accelerate the publication process by expediting data analysis and enabling researchers to draw conclusions more efficiently. 4) Automated Peer Review: AI-powered systems could potentially assist with the peer review process by automatically evaluating quality and validity of manuscripts. While fully automated peer review may not replace human judgment entirely, AI tools can assist in identifying potential reviewers, detecting plagiarism, and assessing the technical soundness of manuscripts, thereby expediting the peer review process. 5) Personalized Recommendations: AI algorithms can analyse researchers' publication histories, interests, and citation patterns to provide personalized recommendations for relevant journals, collaborators, and funding opportunities. This personalized approach can help researchers identify the most suitable publishing venues for their work and enhance their visibility within their respective fields. 6) Enhanced Accessibility and Translation: AI tools can facilitate the translation of scientific publications into multiple languages, making research findings more accessible to a global audience. Furthermore, AI-driven text-to-speech technologies can enable visually impaired individuals to access scientific literature more easily, promoting inclusivity and widening the dissemination of knowledge. 7) Content Generation: AI models like ChatGPT can generate scientific content, such as summaries, abstracts, and even entire manuscripts, based on input from researchers. While human oversight and editing are essential to ensure accuracy and coherence, AI-generated content can serve as a valuable starting point for authors, particularly in fields with established frameworks and methodologies. Overall, AI tools have the potential to streamline various aspects of scientific publishing, from literature review and data analysis to language editing and peer review. By leveraging AI-driven technologies, researchers, publishers, and other stakeholders can enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of scientific communication, ultimately advancing the pace and impact of research across disciplines . Now, having reported that, an analysis on the above sentences returned by ChatGPT is presented. The AI free-to-use chatbot was released on November 30, 2022 by OpenAI in San Francisco, California. At the beginning of 2023 ChatGPT had already been listed as an author on a bunch of research papers. Policies on the use of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) in the writing process have been announced by academic publishers. By last October 2023, 87 out of 100 top scientific journals had provided instructions to authors on the use of generative AI, which can create text, images and other content. 1 As generative AI is continuing to improve, ethical issues have been posed, by considering the current rules which govern publications of scientific research. 2 , 3 In a 2023 survey of more than 1600 scientists, almost 30 % reported that they had used generative AI tools to help write manuscripts, and about 15 % said they had used them to help write grant applications. 4 In addition to the ways mentioned by ChatGPT itself on how these tools are changing scientific publishing, LLMs can help scientists to write code and brainstorm research ideas: more recently, LLMs from other companies are boosting their performances. The potential benefits perceived by the researchers are represented by the ability to edit and translate writing for researchers whose mother language is not English. 1 In addition, generative AI would reduce language barriers in research by 2030 and could take on repetitive tasks, such as literature reviews. 5 It is clear that such tools can help researchers to write papers at a faster pace. But are there any drawbacks? And what are they? LLMs can still make language mistakes. This represents one of the reasons why researchers have to acknowledge LLMs use in their publications. Moreover, there is the risk of stumbling into the so called AI hallucination , a phenomenon wherein a LLM perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to human observers, creating outputs that are nonsensical or altogether inaccurate. These misinterpretations occur due to various factors, including overfitting, training data bias/inaccuracy and high model complexity. The increase in number of scientific publications generated with the help of LLMs may have detrimental effects on the peer review process, as there might not be enough people available to continue to do free peer review. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the use of AI in the review process as submissions under review are privileged communications. Communicating any component of a submitted manuscript to online services, including LLMs may violate the confidentiality privilege, as these and similar LLMs can incorporate all user interactions and materials into their data stores. 6 It should be noticed that the American Association for the Advancement of Science forbids the use of LLMs during the peer review procedure and Springer Nature's policy prohibits peer reviewers from uploading manuscripts into generative-AI tools. 7 , 8 Coming back to the publish or perish model, it can be argued that a shift towards a prioritisation of quality over quantity should be considered. However, the use of LLMs should be documented in the methods or another section of the manuscript. Recently several organizations have come out with defensive statements requiring authors to acknowledge the use of generative AI. Regardless of policies that will be proposed, and changed periodically, the fundamental aspects of originality and quality of the scientific publications still remain. Authors must still take full responsibility for their work. In other words, responsible use of every available resource seems to be the answer together with a change in the reward model in force so far towards high quality publications, thus leaving the quantity as absolute and determining factor of judgement of the track records and scientific careers of researchers. No scientific innovation is bad or good per se , however its use may be, think of nuclear medicine vs nuclear war. As far as the role of AI in publishing is concerned, young researchers should remember that a scientific journal is aimed to (hopefully) spread science and not to support individual academic careers. Therefore, do not stop thinking with your own mind and please always remember ethical and scientific responsibility when using these tools in writing papers. 3 Do not waste time and energy fighting a posteriori with co-authors (and with the chief editors) to be included as the corresponding author of the manuscript.
