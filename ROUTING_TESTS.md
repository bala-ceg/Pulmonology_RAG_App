   - General health query
   - Expected routing: Family Medicine (default)

3. **"I need medical advice"**
   - Generic request
   - Expected routing: Family Medicine (default)

## üéØ Testing Instructions:

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Open browser:** http://localhost:3000

3. **Test each query category:**
   - Type each query into the chat interface
   - Watch the "Smart Medical Router" section in the sidebar
   - Observe how queries are routed to different disciplines

4. **Expected UI Behavior:**
   - Routing status shows "Analyzing query..."
   - After response, shows which disciplines were selected
   - Displays confidence scores and routing method
   - Shows number of sources found

## üîç What to Look For:

### **In the Sidebar:**
- üß† Smart Medical Router section shows routing details
- Discipline tags appear for each query
- Confidence and source information displayed

### **In the Response:**
- **Source annotations** showing which knowledge base was used
- **Routing information** at the end of responses
- **Citations** from relevant medical disciplines
- **Confidence scores** for each source

### **Example Expected Response Format:**
```
üß† **Intelligent Medical Assistant Response**

**Source 1: Organization KB - Cardiology** (Confidence: 95%)
[Response about chest pain from cardiology knowledge base]

**Source 2: User Uploaded Documents** (Confidence: 85%)
[Any relevant user-uploaded content]

**üìö Sources & Citations:**
üìã Cardiology: PDF: sample_knowledge.md (Page 1)

**üéØ Query Routing:** Analyzed and routed to Cardiology
```

## üß™ Advanced Testing:

### **Test Router Logic:**
- Try medical terms vs. common language
- Test synonyms (e.g., "heart attack" vs "myocardial infarction")
- Test complex multi-symptom queries

### **Test Fallback Behavior:**
- Non-medical queries should default to Family Medicine
- Ambiguous queries should show reasoning

### **Test Performance:**
- Multiple rapid queries
- Very long/complex medical questions
- Queries with medical abbreviations

This intelligent routing system demonstrates how AI can automatically determine the most relevant medical specialties for any query, providing a much better user experience than manual discipline selection!
