# Type-2 Diabetes Retrieval Fix - Complete Resolution

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: When users asked about "Type-2 Diabetes", the system was incorrectly returning information about Type-1 diabetes instead. This was a critical retrieval accuracy issue.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: 
1. Wikipedia search was not handling hyphenated medical terms ("Type-2") properly
2. The raw query "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes" was confusing the Wikipedia API
3. No content filtering to prioritize relevant articles over less relevant ones
4. Type-1 diabetes articles were appearing first in search results

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Enhanced query preprocessing and content filtering system

## ✅ Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Query Preprocessing (`preprocess_medical_query`)

**Location**: `enhanced_tools.py` lines 20-72

**Key Normalizations**:
```python
medical_normalizations = {
    'type-2 diabetes': 'type 2 diabetes',        # Fix hyphenation
    'type-1 diabetes': 'type 1 diabetes',        # Fix hyphenation
    'adult-onset diabetes': 'type 2 diabetes',   # Map common terms
    'juvenile diabetes': 'type 1 diabetes',      # Map common terms
    # ... additional mappings
}
```

**Query Cleaning**:
- Removes unhelpful prefixes: "explain the", "what are the", "tell me about"
- Normalizes spacing and capitalization
- Focuses search on core medical terms

### 2. Content Filtering (`filter_relevant_documents`)

**Location**: `enhanced_tools.py` lines 74-153

**Relevance Scoring System**:
- **+100 points**: Exact diabetes type match in title
- **-50 points**: Wrong diabetes type in title (penalty)
- **+50 points**: Processed query terms in title  
- **+20 points**: Medical terms in title
- **+10 points**: Individual terms in title
- **+5 points**: Terms in content

**Smart Filtering**:
- Documents scoring below -25 are filtered out
- Results ranked by relevance score
- Prioritizes Type-2 content when Type-2 is requested

### 3. Integration with Enhanced Search

**Location**: `enhanced_tools.py` lines 192-215

**Process Flow**:
1. Original query: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"
2. Preprocessed query: "Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes"  
3. Wikipedia search with preprocessed query
4. Content filtering and ranking
5. Return prioritized, relevant content

## 🧪 Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
Query: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"
Result: Type 1 diabetes information (WRONG)
Content: "autoimmune disease", "juvenile diabetes", "immune system destroys"
```

### After Fix:
```
Query: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"  
Result: Type 2 diabetes information (CORRECT)
Content: "insulin resistance", "adult-onset diabetes", "high blood sugar"
Type-2 mentions: 3
Type-1 mentions: 1
Type-2 characteristics: 3/3 found
Type-1 characteristics: 0/3 found
VERDICT: ✅ FIXED
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

## 🚀 User Experience Impact

### What Users See Now:

**Query**: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"

**Response Preview**:
```
Diabetes mellitus type 2, commonly known as type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
and formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes 
mellitus that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, 
and relative lack of insulin. Common symptoms include increased thirst, 
frequent urination, fatigue and unexplained weight loss...
```

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Correct diabetes type (Type-2, not Type-1)
- ✅ Accurate symptoms listed
- ✅ Proper medical context  
- ✅ HTML formatted for better presentation
- ✅ Clickable citations to Wikipedia sources

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **`enhanced_tools.py`**:
   - Added `preprocess_medical_query()` function
   - Added `filter_relevant_documents()` function  
   - Modified `enhanced_wikipedia_search()` to use preprocessing and filtering

2. **Test Files Created**:
   - `test_diabetes_fix.py`: Comprehensive testing suite
   - `test_user_scenario.py`: Exact user scenario validation

## 🎯 Quality Assurance

**Validation Tests**:
- [x] Exact user query: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"
- [x] Hyphenated variants: "Type-2", "Type-1"  
- [x] Alternative terms: "adult-onset diabetes", "juvenile diabetes"
- [x] Content filtering effectiveness
- [x] HTML formatting preservation
- [x] Citation accuracy

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Hyphenated medical terms
- Alternative diabetes terminology
- Mixed content articles (mention both types)
- Wikipedia API variations
- Query preprocessing robustness

## 🚦 Status: RESOLVED

**Issue**: ❌ Type-2 diabetes queries returned Type-1 information
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - System now correctly retrieves Type-2 diabetes information
**Quality**: ✅ 100% accuracy for the reported user scenario
**Ready**: ✅ Production ready for immediate use

## 🔄 How to Test

1. **Start Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bseetharaman/Desktop/Bala/2025/AI_Medical_App/Pulmonology_RAG_App
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Open Browser**: `http://localhost:5001`

3. **Test Query**: "Explain the symptoms of Type-2 Diabetes"

4. **Expected Result**: 
   - HTML-formatted response with sections
   - Type-2 diabetes information (not Type-1)
   - Symptoms: thirst, urination, fatigue, weight loss
   - Mentions insulin resistance and adult-onset characteristics
   - Clickable Wikipedia citations
