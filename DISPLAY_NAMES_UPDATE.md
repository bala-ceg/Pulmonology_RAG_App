# User-Friendly Citation Display Names

## ✅ Changes Made

The citation display has been updated to show more user-friendly names in the UI while keeping technical names in the backend.

### Citation Display Mapping

| Technical Name (Backend) | Display Name (UI) | 
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `Local KB` | `Adhoc Documents` |
| `External KB` | `Third Party Research` |

## 🎨 Expected UI Changes

### Before:
```
Citations:
**Local KB**: sample1.pdf
**External KB - Wikipedia**: Type 2 Diabetes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes
**External KB - arXiv**: Medical AI Research by John Doe - https://arxiv.org/abs/1234.5678
```

### After:
```
Citations:
**Adhoc Documents**: sample1.pdf
**Third Party Research - Wikipedia**: Type 2 Diabetes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes
**Third Party Research - arXiv**: Medical AI Research by John Doe - https://arxiv.org/abs/1234.5678
```

## 📝 Response Source Names

The response source names in the main content have also been updated:

### Before:
- "Based on information from Local Knowledge Base..."
- "According to External Knowledge Base..."

### After:  
- "Based on information from Adhoc Documents..."
- "According to Third Party Research..."

## 🔧 What Remains Unchanged

- **Backend code**: All technical names (Local KB, External KB) remain the same in logs and internal processing
- **File paths**: Vector database paths (`kb_local`, `kb_external`) unchanged
- **Configuration**: No configuration changes needed
- **Functionality**: All RAG functionality works exactly the same

## 🚀 How to Apply

1. **Restart your Flask application** to apply the changes
2. **Test with any query** that uses both local and external sources
3. **Check the citations section** to see the new display names

## 🧪 Test Queries

Try these queries to see the new display names:

- **Local content**: "Explain the RDW in critically ill patients"
  - Should show citations from **Adhoc Documents**
  
- **External content**: "What are the symptoms of Type-2 diabetes?"
  - Should show citations from **Third Party Research**

## 📋 Benefits

✅ **More intuitive for users**: "Adhoc Documents" clearly indicates user-uploaded content  
✅ **Professional naming**: "Third Party Research" sounds more authoritative than "External KB"  
✅ **Consistent with UI patterns**: Matches common web application terminology  
✅ **No backend changes**: Maintains all technical functionality  

The changes are purely cosmetic for the user interface while preserving all the technical architecture underneath.
