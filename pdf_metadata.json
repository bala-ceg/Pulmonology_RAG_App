However, limited data are avail- able for critically ill patients with COPD. Methods: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III V1.4 database were ana- lyzed in this retrospective cohort research. The International Classication of Diseases codes were used to identify critically ill patients with COPD. The rst value of RDW was extracted within the rst 24 h after intensive care unit admission. The endpoint was 28-day all-cause mor- tality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between RDW and 28-day mortality. Age, sex, ethnicity, anemia status, comorbidities, clinical therapy, and disease severity score were considered for subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 2,344 patients were included with mean standard deviation age of 72.3 11.3 years, in which 1,739 53.6 patients were men. The increase in RDW was correlated with an increased risk of 28-day mortality in the multivariate logistic regression model odds ratio OR 1.15; 95 condence interval CI 1.091.21. In comparison with the low-RDW group, the middle and high-RDW groups tended to have higher risks of 28-day all-cause mortality OR 95 CI 1.03 0.781.34; OR 95 CI 1.70 1.292.22; P trend  0.0001. Subgroup analyses show no evidence of effect modications on the correlation of RDW and 28-day all-cause mortality. Conclusion: An increase in RDW was associated with an increased risk of 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD. Further studies are required to investigate this association.

Red blood cell distribution width RDW is a quanti- tative measure of circulating erythrocyte volume variability, and it is measured as part of a complete blood count examination. Furthermore, RDW has signicant asso- ciations with the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease,5-17 heart failure,18,19 stroke,20,21 acute pulmonary embolism,22-25 community- acquired pneumonia,26-28 peripheral occlusive artery dis- ease,29 cancer,30,31 sepsis,32 and kidney disease.33-35 Fur- thermore, an increase in RDW is associated with right ventricular dysfunction,36,37 pulmonary arterial hyperten- sion,37 and mortality.38-41TagedEnd TagedPHowever, previous studies employed small sample sizes and did not adjust for other potential confounders. In addi- tion, limited studies have focused on the correlation between RDW and outcome in critically ill COPD patients.TagedEnd TagedPThus, the present study aimed to investigate the associa- tion between RDW and 28-day all-cause mortality in criti- cally ill COPD patients by using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III MIMIC-III database. We hypothesized that increasing RDW in critically ill COPD patients is related to increased risk of mortality.TagedEnd TagedH1MethodsTagedEnd TagedH2Database introductionTagedEnd TagedPMIMIC-III database version 1.4 is open to the public and contains information on over 50,000 patients hospitalized to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centers intensive care unit ICU between 2001 and 2012.42 This database can be accessed at https:mimic.physionet.org. Enqian Liu obtained access to the database No. 35919439. The use of the data was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston, MA and Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA.43 The requirement for written informed consent was waived, because each patient information in the database was ano- nymized and de-identied.43 The ethics committee of Lishui TagedEndTagedPMunicipal Central Hospital approved this study no. 2021184.TagedEnd TagedH2Population selection criteriaTagedEnd TagedPData from each patients initial ICU admission were ana- lyzed. Patients with COPD were selected using International Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision ICD-9 codes 491.20, 491.21, 491.22, and 496. We excluded patients aged 18 years, those admitted to the ICU for 24 h, those with survival times 0, and those with missing RDW data.TagedEnd TagedH2Data extractionTagedEnd TagedPData were extracted using PostgreSQL version 9.6 and a structured query language. The following variable data were extracted: age, sex, ethnicity, weight, heart rate, systolic blood pressure SBP, diastolic blood pressure DBP, tem- perature, respiratory rate, percutaneous oxygen saturation SpO2, mean blood pressure MBP, vasopressor use, renal replacement therapy RRT, congestive heart failure, hyper- tension, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, sepsis, liver disease, acute kidney injury AKI, renal failure, serum sodium, serum creatinine, serum potassium, blood urea nitrogen BUN, serum hemoglobin, serum bicarbonate, serum glu- cose, serum hematocrit, anion gap, serum chloride, plate- let, and white blood cell WBC, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment SOFA score, and Simplied Acute Physiology Score II SAPS II. The baseline data were obtained within the rst 24 h after ICU admission. The initial value was con- sidered for a variable that was measured multiple times within 24 h after ICU admission. Comorbidities, except AKI, were diagnosed according to ICD-9 codes. Severe sepsis was dened as the presence of either a a combination of ICD-9 codes for infection and one or more organ dysfunctions,44 or b the ICD-9 code for severe sepsis 995.92 or septic shock 785.52.45 According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines, AKI was induced within the rst 24 h of ICU admission and was identied based on serum creatinine and urine output.46 Anemia was diagnosed as a hemoglobin level 12 gdL in women and 13 gdL in men according to the World Health Organization guidelines.47 The clinical outcome was the 28- day all-cause mortality after ICU admission.TagedEnd TagedH2Statistical analysisTagedEnd TagedPParticipants were divided into tertiles based on RDW levels. Continuous data were expressed as mean standard devia- tion or median interquartile range, while categorical vari- ables were presented as percentages. The baseline characteristics of the different RDW tertile groups were ana- lyzed using chi-square test for categorical variables, one- way analysis of variance test for normally distributed data, and Kruskal-Wallis H test for non-normally distributed data.

More than 10 VIFs showed multicollinearity.

To investigate the non-linearity further, we turned RDW into a categorical variable based on the tertiles, and then into a continuous variable by entering the tertiles median values into the variable. For the sensi- tivity analysis, interaction and subgroup analyses were based on age 75 and 75 years, sex, ethnicity, congestive heart failure, diabetes, renal failure, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, liver disease, sepsis, anemia, AKI, RRT, vaso- pressor use, ventilation, SAPS II 37 and 37, and SOFA score 4 and 4. Missing values were not found in the cat- egory variables. Missing values for continuous variables were imputed using the mean normal data or median non-nor- mal data.

The baseline characteristics of the RDW tertile groupings are shown in Table 1. The mean patient age was 72.3  11.3 years, and approximately 53.6 patients were men. RDW values at baseline varied from 11.50 to 28.20 median 14.70; mean 15.18. No signi- cant differences were observed between the different groups concerning sex, heart rate, platelet level, serum TagedEndTagedPchloride, glucose, and serum sodium levels, hypertension, and vasopressor use all P  0.05. Patients in the highest RDW tertile group were likely to develop congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, real failure, liver dis- ease, sepsis, anemia, AKI, and RRT, and were less likely to require ventilation than patients in the lowest group. As the RDW increased, respiratory rate, weight, anion gap, potas- sium, creatinine, and BUN levels, SOFA score, and SAPS II increased, whereas SBP, DBP, MBP, temperature, SpO2, and hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC, and bicarbonate levels decreased.TagedEnd TagedH2Results of logistic regressionTagedEnd TagedPThe independent effects of RDW on 28-day all-cause mortal- ity in critically ill COPD patients were evaluated by con- structing three different logistic regression models.TagedEnd TagedPLogistic regression analysis for 28-day mortality Table 2 show that RDW was positively related to the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality unadjusted odds ratio OR 1.20; 95 CI 1.151.25.

After adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, higher RDW values were correlated to higher risks of 28-day mortality OR 1.21; 95 CI 1.161.27. In comparison with the rst tertile group, the ORs were 1.18 95 CI 0.931.51 and 2.37 95 CI 1.892.98 in the second and third tertile groups, respectively. RDW was strongly correlated with 28- day all-cause mortality OR 1.15; 95 CI 1.091.21 in Model 3. Furthermore, a higher RDW value was related to a greater risk of 28-day all-cause mortality in the second RDW tertile group OR 1.03; 95 CI 0.781.34 and the third RDW tertile group OR 1.70; 95 CI 1.292.22 after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, weight, SBP, MBP, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, hematocrit level, platelet level, anion gap; cre- atinine, bicarbonate, chloride, glucose, BUN, WBC, and potassium levels, SAPS II, SOFA score, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, sepsis, liver disease, vasopressor use, ventila- tion, RRT, AKI, and anemia.

In addition, the stratied result supports the con- sistent nding.TagedEnd TagedPRDW is related to short- and long-term mortality in patients with internal diseases. In recent years, RDW has received substantial attention in patients with COPD. Sey- han et al.38 retrospectively followed up 270 patients with stable COPD for a median period of 36 months range, 2052 months and found that higher RDW levels are related to higher mortality risks OR 1.12; 95 CI 1.011.24. After controlling for age, leukocyte count, mean corpuscular vol- ume, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, results show that RDW was related to increased risk of in-hospital mortality in a study among 330 patients with acute COPD exacerbations.39 Epstein et al.40 discovered that high RDW at admission 14.5 was signicantly related to the 60-day composite endpoint of readmission or mortality after discharge OR 1.83; 95 CI 1.222.74 in a cohort of 539 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Hu et al.41 conducted a pro- spective observational research among 442 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and observed that increased RDW 13.75 was strongly correlated with the risk of in- hospital death relative risk 4.30; 95 CI 1.989.58 and the risk of 1-year mortality HR 1.64; 95 CI 1.082.50. How- ever, previous research involved limited sample sizes, and adjustments were not made for a large number of poten- tially confounding factors. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, limited research has focused on the correlation between RDW and mortality in critically ill patients with COPD. Our results support these earlier investigations.38-41 In the present study, which included 3,244 critically ill patients with COPD, an increase in RDW was related to the increased risk of 28-day all-cause mortality based on multi- variate logistic regression analysis.TagedEnd TagedPAging48-51 and ethnicity52,53 are associated with RDW val- ues. Different epidemiological studies have reported incon- sistent results in terms of the relationship between RDW and sex.49-51 The correlation between RDW and 28-day mortality was constant across all subgroups in our analysis, regardless TagedEndTagedPof age 75 and 75 years, sex, or ethnicity. COPD comor- bidities include hypertension, congestive heart failure, dia- betes, and cardiac arrhythmias, and comorbidities mainly cause mortality among COPD patients.54 Sepsis and AKI fre- quent occur in ICU patients and are related with poor outcomes.55,56 The results of RDW and mortality were stable in these subgroups. RDW is commonly used for anemia differ- ential diagnosis. Higher RDW levels are related to an increased risk of death, regardless of presence or absence of anemia. The effects of treatment and illness severity score should be considered. The results were consistent in differ- ent subgroups according to vasopressor use, ventilation, SAPS II 37 and 37, and SOFA score 4 and 4.TagedEnd TagedPThe mechanisms underlying the increase in RDW are unclear. To the best of our knowledge, high RDW level is cor- related with an inammatory state. Inammation can affect iron metabolism and bone marrow function, thus inhibiting erythropoietin-induced erythrocyte maturation.57,58 This condition results in the release of immature red blood cells into the circulation and disruption in red blood cell clear- ance, thus increasing RDW. Commonly, critically ill patients exhibit systemic inammatory responses.59 These mecha- nisms may assist in exploring the correlation between RDW and poor outcomes in COPD patients. Thus, RDW may be related to poor outcomes in patients with COPD.TagedEnd TagedPOur study has some limitations. First, considering that the present study involves observational research, causal inferences cannot be detirmined. Moreover, the analysis was adjusted for the available confounders, but our observations may have been inuenced by residual measured andor unmeasured confounders. In addition, we excluded patients aged 18 years. Therefore, our ndings cannot be general- ized to these patients. Furthermore, RDW values could have been affected by many factors, such as erythropoietin use and iron or vitamin B12 deciency, although considering the retrospective nature of the study, these situations could not be distinguished. Moreover, we only focused on the initial RDW value obtained within the rst 24 h after ICU admission. The effect of RDW uctuations on prognosis is unknown. In addition, the ICD-9 code-based denition of severe sepsis may underestimate the actual incidence of sepsis. Some cases of sepsis may not be covered by the codes.

                "text": "LETTER TO THE EDITOR Clinical impact of Xpert MTBRIF Ultra for pulmonary TB diagnosis under routine conditions in a reference center in Brazil Dear Editor, According to the literature, there is insufcient scientic data on the clinical impact, pre-post-analytical barriers, and health-care delivery, regarding the implementation of molecular tests for tuberculosis TB diagnosis recom- mended by World Health Organization WHO under eld conditions in high burden countries.1 The molecular test Ultra assay Xpert Ultra; Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA offers a lower limit of detection for Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB,2 being particularly important to detect paucibacillary TB presentations - extrapulmonary TB, TBHIV coinfection and pediatric TB.5 Also, the test offers a semi-quantitative category of result named trace, which is considered a concern. We aimed to evaluate the performance of Ultra under routine conditions in respiratory specimens tested at Tho- rax Diseases Institute - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A diagnostic test study using secondary data from the Mycobacterial Laboratory included all spon- taneous sputum SS, induced sputum IS and bronchoal- veolar lavage BAL submitted to Ultra, smear microscopy and automatized culture, between December 2019 and December 2020 Ethics Committee approval 01561018.3.0000.5257. Tests with indeterminate results, contaminated cultures, non-tuberculosis myco- bacteria identication and those performed during patients follow-up were excluded. Cases were classied as Conrmed TB MTB identication on culture, Non-conrmed TB clinicalradiological diagno- sis, treated and cured or Not-TB other diagnosis con- cluded. Data for HIV-status were performed searching on https:laudo.aids.gov.brlogin. Medcalc Statistical Software MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium was used for statistical analysis. 722 specimens 330 BAL, 260 SS and 132 IS were ana- lyzed, with 59105 known HIV status being positive. Ultras overall diagnostic sensitivity was 93.5 with a specicity of 91.2. In smear positive samples, Ultra was 100 sensitive versus 87.6 in smear negative. For different pulmonary specimens, Ultra was more accu- rate on BAL 93.6, followed by IS and SS Accuracy Acc 90.9 and 89.6, respectively Table 1. The fty false-positive Ultra results included 13 previous TB cases. In 10154 TB cases, Ultra lead to false-negative results, and in all of them mycobacterial cultures identied MTB growth. 63722 respiratory specimens presented trace results, ve 7.9 with conrmed TB and 14 22.2 with non-con- rmed TB. 1044 cases classied as not-TB had previous TB Fig. 1. Therefore, Ultra was 93.5 sensitive and 91.2 spe- cic. If trace results were considered as MTB not detected, sensitivity would fall to 81.1 with 98.9 of specicity. Whether the previous history was taken into consideration for classication of trace as MTB not detected and attributed to DNA fragments of non-viable bacilli, sensitivity and speci- city would be both 93.5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst study under routine conditions and in a scenario of high prevalence of TB, as Brazil, that analyzes the performance of Ultra in such a large sample, which turn this letter innovative and informative. Recently, Xpert MTBRIF showed a good performance in different pulmonary specimens, with emphasis in IS Acc97.3 In the present study, Ultra on IS had a sensitivity of 96.5 and a lower specicity of 89.3, which is compati- ble with what the new version proposes. Considering the dif- ferences between our sample and Zars et al,4 which addresses a pediatric sample, Ultra also presented a better performance on IS when compared to nasopharyngeal aspi- rate. Despite our results showing the greater accuracy on BAL, the performance of Ultra on IS deserves to be highlighted, considering the costs and safety of the method, which can be substituted for BAL for TB diagnosis. For Mazzola and colleagues,5 Ultras proportion of true- positive results exceeds the false-positives: the latter being avoidable in scenarios with a low pretest probability. In our casuistry, considering only the false-positive results attrib- uted to previous TB history, 70.6 presented trace-results. Independently of HIV-status, trace category increased case detection by 2.1 without signicant loss of specicity in the study of Andama et al.6 In our research, if trace- results were considered negative in all cases, sensitivity would fall to 81.1, with a higher specicity 98.9. The other way, 44 cases would be false-positive, ten with previ- ous TB. Therefore, if the history of previous pulmonary TB had been evaluated, and Ultra trace result considered as https:doi.org10.1016j.pulmoe.2023.05.007 2531-0437 2023 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

In Kendalls7 publication, Ultras trace results increased overtreatment by more than 50, nonetheless it avoided 50 of deaths. Therefore, the interpretation of trace results requires a balance between case detection and overtreat- ment as established by Global Laboratory Initiative of the Stop TB partnership. Our limitations were mostly attributed to diagnostic test studies conducted in routine conditions. We could not ana- lyze Ultra results according to HIV-status in all specimens and we didnt have access to all previous TB history.

                "text": "EDITORIAL TagedH1Two years of COVID-19: Trends in rehabilitationTagedEnd TagedPRehabilitation is an important therapeutic strategy for patients who are exposed to COVID-19-related complications and particularly for those at risk of prolonged hospitalisa- tion. Two years ago we had a paucity of information on deal- ing with such an unprecedented situation except for general recommendations.1 Among these, in April 2020 an Italian position paper considering different phases of the disease and organisational issues, has furnished detailed recommen- dations that have substantially contributed to the develop- ment of safe and appropriate rehabilitative interventions particularly for the provision of respiratory physiotherapy.2 The information released in that document is still valid and consistent after two years. As already pointed out, from the COVID-19 pandemic we have learned that physiotherapists already substantially contributed to implementing appropri- ate procedures and treatments at the beginning of the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak.3 However, at the time of writing, we have now more data available, and we can infer additional details about rehabilitation for patients with COVID-19 at different stages of the disease.TagedEnd TagedPCOVID-19 has several extrapulmonary manifestations of rehabilitative interest, including neurological, physical, and functional limitations4-7 which can last even months after the acute illness phase.8,9 Over time, an increasing number of studies have been published reporting data about rehabil- itative therapies adopted and implemented in COVID-19 set- tings. Observational studies are conrmed to be particularly helpful during this COVID-19 pandemic since they allow researchers to understand better different characteristics of the disease and related rehabilitative treatments to be implemented accordingly.10TagedEnd TagedPDuring the rst pandemic wave, one of the most worrying concerns was represented by hypercoagulability, a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 complications, with potential repercussions on the rehabilitative treatment.11TagedEnd TagedPThe surge in cases around the globe has stimulated easing administrative procedures to transfer hospitalised COVID-19 patients from acute COVID-19 hospitals to inpatient rehabili- tation facilities producing positive effects on availability of beds.12 In addition, rehabilitation has played a crucial role TagedEndTagedPin facilitating patients activity and mobility, a timely dis- charge, and the possibility of being discharged home or to Covid hotels from acute hospitals.13 Several studies of acute inpatient rehabilitation conducted during the rst pandemic wave, have demonstrated that an early rehabilita- tive approach was effective at improving outcomes and facilitating discharge to home.14-18 Nevertheless, the same efcacy was not conrmed when considering mortality; while in some studies rehabilitation was associated with reduced mortality,19 in others patients had a longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, a longer ICU stay, a more extended hospital stay and higher mortality rates.20 It could be speculated that such differences are probably correlated to pre-existing comorbidities and patient selection.TagedEnd TagedPFrom data available in the literature, the rehabilitative treatment provided in acute and subacute hospital settings seems to commence within the rst 3-10 days after hospital admission, to be constituted by 1530-minute sessions hav- ing heterogeneous frequencies ranging from twice a week to a daily schedule.14-21TagedEnd TagedPAnother aspect emerging from different clinical experi- ences is the use of assisted techniques implemented with rehabilitation such as muscle electrical stimulation and in- bed ergometry, showing they are feasible and contribute to reducing personnel exposure and saving personal protective equipment PPE.15,22 Indeed, the availability of PPE was a primary concern during the rst pandemic wave. Although at the time of writing it seems there are no critical limita- tions to obtaining sufcient quantities of PPE, their uninter- rupted use during the personnel shifts continues to be a cause of fatigue and attention, particularly regarding undressing and correct usage procedures.23 In addition, high-risk interventions such as patient pronation, oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and chest physiotherapy, continue to be a matter of attention regarding personnel exposure. At the same time, manufacturers have been encouraged to develop a new generation of respiratory devi- ces taking into consideration safety issues related to ventila- tion in critical settings dedicated to patients with respiratory viruses.24 To reduce personnel exposure and save https:doi.org10.1016j.pulmoe.2022.01.012 2531-0437 2022 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

However, the most critical concern has been and still is at the time of writing avoiding pressure on health care systems worldwide. In doing this, it is evident that expediting patient ow from acute to step-down units is a solution to making more beds available for those needing care. Such an approach might be facilitated by treating patients as soon as they are hospitalised, sharing a culture of mobility within the care settings. In this context, acute inpatient rehabilitation is a valuable means of accomplishing the mission to have patients participate in motor activities as much as possible and be able to execute respiratory exer- cises, even under challenging clinical conditions.25TagedEnd TagedPThe principal barriers to developing these abilities are often represented by the lack of human resources and the absence of a mobility culture within the teams. Neverthe- less, these concerns can be addressed and observed from three perspectives: patient, organisational structure, and professionals. For the patient, pre-existing daily autonomy, care complexity and comorbidities are predictors of compli- ance with the therapeutic measures and clinical outcomes. It is well known that appropriate stafng, skill mix, training strategies, and turnover of human resources can inuence the determination of the time reserved for patient assis- tance and the quality of multidisciplinary integration and communicative strategies between hospital settings. Fur- thermore, the effective management of the patients clini- cal information contributes to enhancing the continuity of care from acute to step-down units as well as from hospitals to territorial rehabilitative facilities.TagedEnd TagedPEventually, from the professional's point of view, sharing common schemes for preserving motor, respiratory, swallow- ing functions should be implemented within the teams because they will inuence the patients journey to home or post-acute rehabilitative structures and expected out- comes. Patients who do not require further hospitalisation in out-patient settings, but are still in need of care, can be discharged home and continue to follow a specic rehabili- tative protocol via telerehabilitation. The COVID-19 pan- demic has contributed to the development of telemedicine strategies that are proving of crucial importance for reduc- ing the risk of infection and responding to the need of care for patients who, during the rst pandemic wave, had no access due to the contraction of healthcare services. Initial experiences of telerehabilitation have demonstrated that it is feasible and produces positive effects on functional capac- ity, exercise tolerance and dyspnoea.26TagedEnd TagedPHowever, one of the most positive aspects of the reha- bilitative pathway within critical settings is the capacity of sharing different tasks among health care professio- nals, involving various rehabilitation disciplines. In addi- tion, COVID-19 has highlighted the ability of team members to cooperate, producing a virtuous circle of multidisciplinarity.27,28 Last, but not least the published studies did not on average report a high level of TagedEndTagedPcontamination among the rehabilitative staff, even in those exposed to aerosol-generating procedures.29 Indeed, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is crucial to reducing the burden of care for families and caregivers, expediting patients return to social and working contexts, thus mitigating costs.TagedEnd TagedPAfter two years of COVID-19, we are observing that rehabilitation has several components that are t to address different phases of the disease. An early rehabili- tative approach in ICUs and sub-intensive settings has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible; to the same extent, patients developing long-COVID syndrome have found a prompt response which is further implemented by telerehabilitation.TagedEnd TagedPWave after wave, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that health care systems are facing the same problems and difculties worldwide. Nevertheless, rehabilitation profes- sionals providing care in different settings contribute to establishing a rehabilitative regimen for patients with COVID-19, paving the way for further advancements.TagedEnd TagedH1Consent to publish dataTagedEnd TagedPNot applicable.TagedEnd TagedH1Conicts of interestTagedEnd TagedPThe authors have no conicts of interest to declare.TagedEnd TagedH1FundingTagedEnd TagedPThe authors received no nancial support for the research, authorship, andor publication of this article.TagedEnd TagedH1ReferencesTagedEnd TagedP 1.

The patient was feeling well at the 2-month follow-up. MSGP is a rare endobronchial papillary tumor charac- terized by a mixture of squamous and glandular epithelial cells. MSGP occurs more frequently in men who smoke and is commonly found in the left lingular segment.1 As the majority of MSGPs present with a lung mass on the CT image,2 endobronchial presentation of this MSGP is uncommon. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treat- ment as MSGP can potentially advance to carcinoma.2 In patients with limited endobronchial lesions, endoscopic therapy is an option.

                "text": "LETTER TO THE EDITOR Lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis: Results from a national cohort Dear Editor, Lung involvement can occur in 1080 of rheumatoid arthri- tis RA patients,1,2 mostly within the rst 5 years of RA diag- nosis.1 It includes interstitial lung disease ILD, airways disease, pleural disease and nodules.1 Pulmonary hyperten- sion and direct toxicity from RA therapy have also been described.1 Despite therapeutic advances,2 lung disease remains responsible for 1020 of RA mortality.1 This observational, retrospective, multicenter study characterizes lung involvement in a nationwide cohort of RA patients, identies factors associated with lung disease and describes treatments used in patients with RA-ILD. All RA patients aged 18 years at diagnosis prospectively followed in Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Registry Reuma.pt were included from 2008 to February 2022. Lung involvement diagnosis was based on high resolution computed tomography CT andor histopathological data. The date of the exam was considered the date of lung dis- ease diagnosis. Demographics and clinical data, including smoking habits, RA duration, rheumatoid factor RF, anti- citrullinated peptide antibodies ACPA, secondary Sjogrens syndrome SS2 and subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, were retrieved at last visit. Erosive disease was based on X-rays performed at any time. Currentprevious disease modifying antirheumatic drugs DMARDs and antibrotics were recorded. Missing information was lled in from hospital records, whenever possible. Continuous variables were expressed as mean  S.D. or median with interquartile range IQR and categorical varia- bles as absolute values and frequencies. Groups were com- pared using qui-square test and independent samples t test or MannWhitney test, as appropriate. Statistically signi- cantly different variables were included in a logistic regres- sion analysis for identifying features independently associated with lung disease. A signicance level of 5 was considered. SPSS version 28.0 IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA was used. The study was approved by the Coordinator and Scientic Board of Reuma.pt and by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Garcia de Orta. All data registered on Reuma.pt is subjected to an informed consent signed by the patient. From 9415 RA patients registered in Reuma.pt, 7473 79.4 were female, with mean age of 62.3  13.6 years and median disease duration of 12.4 IQR 6.520.6 years at last visit. Lung disease was documented in 298 3.2 patients. The median interval between joint and pulmonary symptoms was 5 IQR 115 years. Twenty-one 7.8; 28 missing data patients had lung disease as rst manifestation. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of different types of lung involvement. Thirteen patients had more than one type of lung involvement. None of the patients with rheumatoid lung nodules had subcutaneous nodules. Two patients with CT showing peribronchial micronodules and a uffy tree-in- bud pattern had lung biopsy, which documented follicular bronchiolitis. Table 1 shows clinical characteristics of patients with and without lung involvement. Continuous variables are expressed as mean  S.D. if they had a normal distribution, or median with interquartile range IQR if not normally distributed. Categorical variables are presented as absolute values n and frequencies . In multivariate analysis, ever smoking OR  2.1; 95CI:1.43.9, p  0.001, positive ACPA OR  2.1; 95CI:1.23.6, p  0.002 and older age OR  1.05 per year; 95CI:1.031.07, p  0.001 were positively associ- ated with lung disease, whereas previous treatment with methotrexate MTX OR  0.32; 95CI:0.220.46, p  0.001 and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors TNFi OR  0.48; 95CI: 0.320.7, p  0.001 had a negative association with RA-associated lung disease. At lung disease diagnosis, 169 56.7 patients were tak- ing MTX, 131 44 other conventional synthetic DMARDs, 49 16.4 TNFi, 13 4.4 tocilizumab, 9 3 rituximab, 2 0.7 abatacept and 2 0.7 Janus Kinase inhibitors. After lung disease diagnosis, 77 out of 169 patients 45.6 were kept under MTX. After ILD diagnosis, rituximab became the most pre- scribed biologic, in 62 34.1 patients, followed by toci- lizumab 15 patients; 8.2 and abatacept 7 patients; 3.8. TNFi were used in 16 8.8 patients. Twelve RA- ILD patients received antibrotics 6 nintedanib, 6 pirfe- nidone. The involvement of several centers explains why the number of 6 authors has been exceeded. https:doi.org10.1016j.pulmoe.2023.05.009 2531-0437 2023 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

                "text": "The proportion of RA patients with lung involvement in our cohort was lower than that reported in the literature,1 which might be explained by underreporting in Reuma.pt and because in most cases lung disease was only screened after respiratory symptoms developed. High-resolution CT is now considered the gold-standard for diagnosis. Lung biopsy is only performed when imaging features are inconclusive or when the etiology of lung disease is unclear.1,2 Besides, taking into consideration the pathogenic role of RA-related autoantibodies, smoking and occupational dust in RA-associated lung disease1,3 and the fact that articular disease activity seems to be higher in patients with RA-ILD,1 the lower smoking prevalence rates in Portugal compared to other European countries4 and the lower aggressiveness of RA in southern Europe than in other geographic areas5 can also contribute to the lower prevalence of RA-associated lung disease in our cohort. In 7.8 of RA patients, lung dis- ease was the rst disease manifestation, with recent data suggesting that the lung may be a potential mucosal site of generation of RA-related autoimmunity.3 RA-ILD was the most prevalent type of lung involvement 70.1 of the patients with lung disease, which is in line with published data.1 Patients with RA-associated lung disease had a higher fre- quency of smoking habits, positive RF and ACPA and erosive disease, consistent with the literature.1,3 However, 24 patients with lung disease were negative for RF and ACPA, with only 2 having smoking habits. This means that other factors may contribute to lung disease development. Data on MTX and others DMARDs causingworsening pre- existing ILD in RA patients is controversial,2,6 with recent data demonstrating that controlling systemic inammation can delayprevent RA-ILD development.3 Despite being a retrospective study, this constitutes an extensive characterization of a considerable number of RA patients with lung involvement and conrms the reproduc- ibility of classic risk factors for lung disease7 in a national cohort. In the future, the identication of new risk factors and the validation of risk scores, could help identify patients at high risk of RA-associated lung disease that might benet from a screening strategy including an HRCT at disease diag- nosis, similar to what is already recommended for systemic sclerosis.8 Conicts of interest All authors declare no competing interests.
