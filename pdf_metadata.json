However, limited data are avail-\nable for critically ill patients with COPD.\nMethods: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III V1.4 database were ana-\nlyzed in this retrospective cohort research. The International Classi\ufb01cation of Diseases codes\nwere used to identify critically ill patients with COPD. The \ufb01rst value of RDW was extracted\nwithin the \ufb01rst 24 h after intensive care unit admission. The endpoint was 28-day all-cause mor-\ntality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship\nbetween RDW and 28-day mortality. Age, sex, ethnicity, anemia status, comorbidities, clinical\ntherapy, and disease severity score were considered for subgroup analysis.\nResults: A total of 2,344 patients were included with mean (standard deviation) age of 72.3\n(11.3) years, in which 1,739 (53.6%) patients were men. The increase in RDW was correlated with\nan increased risk of 28-day mortality in the multivariate logistic regression model (odds ratio\n[OR] 1.15; 95% con\ufb01dence interval [CI] 1.09\u00011.21). In comparison with the low-RDW group, the\nmiddle and high-RDW groups tended to have higher risks of 28-day all-cause mortality (OR [95%\nCI] 1.03 [0.78\u00011.34]; OR [95% CI] 1.70 [1.29\u00012.22]; P trend < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses show\nno evidence of effect modi\ufb01cations on the correlation of RDW and 28-day all-cause mortality.\nConclusion: An increase in RDW was associated with an increased risk of 28-day all-cause\nmortality in critically ill patients with COPD. Further studies are required to investigate\nthis association.\nTagedEndTAGEDPKEYWORDS\nChronic obstructive\npulmonary disease;\nRed blood cell distri-\nbution width;\nMortality;\nMultiparameter intel-\nligent monitoring in\nintensive care IIITagedEnd\nTagedEnd * Corresponding author at: Department of Gastroenterology, Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang 323000, China.\nE-mail address: jiangwx90@163.com (W.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a quanti-\ntative\nmeasure\nof\ncirculating\nerythrocyte\nvolume\nvariability, and it is measured as part of a complete blood\ncount examination. Furthermore, RDW has signi\ufb01cant asso-\nciations with the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in\npatients with coronary artery disease,5-17 heart failure,18,19\nstroke,20,21 acute pulmonary embolism,22-25 community-\nacquired pneumonia,26-28 peripheral occlusive artery dis-\nease,29 cancer,30,31 sepsis,32 and kidney disease.33-35 Fur-\nthermore, an increase in RDW is associated with right\nventricular dysfunction,36,37 pulmonary arterial hyperten-\nsion,37 and mortality.38-41TagedEnd\nTagedPHowever, previous studies employed small sample sizes\nand did not adjust for other potential confounders.

Hu et al.41 conducted a pro-\nspective observational research among 442 patients with\nacute exacerbations of COPD and observed that increased\nRDW (\u000113.75%) was strongly correlated with the risk of in-\nhospital death (relative risk 4.30; 95% CI 1.98\u00019.58) and the\nrisk of 1-year mortality (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.08\u00012.50). How-\never, previous research involved limited sample sizes, and\nadjustments were not made for a large number of poten-\ntially confounding factors. Furthermore, to the best of our\nknowledge, limited research has focused on the correlation\nbetween RDW and mortality in critically ill patients with\nCOPD. Our results support these earlier investigations.38-41\nIn the present study, which included 3,244 critically ill\npatients with COPD, an increase in RDW was related to the\nincreased risk of 28-day all-cause mortality based on multi-\nvariate logistic regression analysis.TagedEnd\nTagedPAging48-51 and ethnicity52,53 are associated with RDW val-\nues. Different epidemiological studies have reported incon-\nsistent results in terms of the relationship between RDW and\nsex.49-51 The correlation between RDW and 28-day mortality\nwas constant across all subgroups in our analysis, regardless\nTagedEndTagedPof age (<75 and \u000175 years), sex, or ethnicity. COPD comor-\nbidities include hypertension, congestive heart failure, dia-\nbetes, and cardiac arrhythmias, and comorbidities mainly\ncause mortality among COPD patients.54 Sepsis and AKI fre-\nquent occur in ICU patients and are related with poor\noutcomes.55,56 The results of RDW and mortality were stable\nin these subgroups. RDW is commonly used for anemia differ-\nential diagnosis. Higher RDW levels are related to an\nincreased risk of death, regardless of presence or absence of\nanemia. The effects of treatment and illness severity score\nshould be considered. The results were consistent in differ-\nent subgroups according to vasopressor use, ventilation,\nSAPS II (<37 and \u000137), and SOFA score (<4 and \u00014).TagedEnd\nTagedPThe mechanisms underlying the increase in RDW are\nunclear. To the best of our knowledge, high RDW level is cor-\nrelated with an in\ufb02ammatory state. In\ufb02ammation can affect\niron metabolism and bone marrow function, thus inhibiting\nerythropoietin-induced erythrocyte maturation.57,58 This\ncondition results in the release of immature red blood cells\ninto the circulation and disruption in red blood cell clear-\nance, thus increasing RDW. Commonly, critically ill patients\nexhibit systemic in\ufb02ammatory responses.59 These mecha-\nnisms may assist in exploring the correlation between RDW\nand poor outcomes in COPD patients. Thus, RDW may be\nrelated to poor outcomes in patients with COPD.TagedEnd\nTagedPOur study has some limitations. First, considering that\nthe present study involves observational research, causal\ninferences cannot be detirmined. Moreover, the analysis was\nadjusted for the available confounders, but our observations\nmay have been in\ufb02uenced by residual measured and/or\nunmeasured confounders. In addition, we excluded patients\naged <18 years. Therefore, our \ufb01ndings cannot be general-\nized to these patients. Furthermore, RDW values could have\nbeen affected by many factors, such as erythropoietin use\nand iron or vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency, although considering the\nretrospective nature of the study, these situations could not\nbe distinguished. Moreover, we only focused on the initial\nRDW value obtained within the \ufb01rst 24 h after ICU admission.\nThe effect of RDW \ufb02uctuations on prognosis is unknown. In\naddition, the ICD-9 code-based de\ufb01nition of severe sepsis\nmay underestimate the actual incidence of sepsis. Some\ncases of sepsis may not be covered by the codes.

                "text": "LETTER TO THE EDITOR\nClinical impact of Xpert\u0001 MTB/RIF\nUltra for pulmonary TB diagnosis\nunder routine conditions in a\nreference center in Brazil\nDear Editor,\nAccording to the literature, there is insuf\ufb01cient scienti\ufb01c\ndata on the clinical impact, pre-post-analytical barriers,\nand health-care delivery, regarding the implementation of\nmolecular tests for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis recom-\nmended by World Health Organization (WHO) under \ufb01eld\nconditions in high burden countries.1\nThe molecular test Ultra assay (Xpert Ultra; Cepheid Inc.,\nSunnyvale, CA, USA) offers a lower limit of detection for\nMycobacterium\ntuberculosis\n(MTB),2\nbeing\nparticularly\nimportant to detect paucibacillary TB presentations -\nextrapulmonary TB, TB/HIV coinfection and pediatric TB.5\nAlso, the test offers a semi-quantitative category of result\nnamed \u201ctrace\u201d, which is considered a concern.\nWe aimed to evaluate the performance of Ultra under\nroutine conditions in respiratory specimens tested at Tho-\nrax Diseases Institute - Federal University of Rio de\nJaneiro, Brazil. A diagnostic test study using secondary\ndata from the Mycobacterial Laboratory included all spon-\ntaneous sputum (SS), induced sputum (IS) and bronchoal-\nveolar lavage (BAL) submitted to Ultra, smear microscopy\nand automatized culture, between December 2019 and\nDecember\n2020\n(Ethics\nCommittee\napproval\n#01561018.3.0000.5257).\nTests\nwith\nindeterminate\nresults, contaminated cultures, non-tuberculosis myco-\nbacteria\nidenti\ufb01cation\nand\nthose\nperformed\nduring\npatient\u2019s follow-up were excluded.\nCases were classi\ufb01ed as Con\ufb01rmed TB (MTB identi\ufb01cation\non culture), Non-con\ufb01rmed TB (clinical/radiological diagno-\nsis, treated and cured) or Not-TB (other diagnosis con-\ncluded). Data for HIV-status were performed searching on\nhttps://laudo.aids.gov.br/login.\nMedcalc\u0001 Statistical Software (MedCalc Software Ltd,\nOstend, Belgium) was used for statistical analysis.\n722 specimens (330 BAL, 260 SS and 132 IS) were ana-\nlyzed, with 59/105 known HIV status being positive. Ultra\u2019s\noverall diagnostic sensitivity was 93.5% with a speci\ufb01city of\n91.2%. In smear positive samples, Ultra was 100% sensitive\nversus 87.6% in smear negative.\nFor different pulmonary specimens, Ultra was more accu-\nrate on BAL (93.6%), followed by IS and SS [Accuracy (Acc)\n90.9% and 89.6%, respectively] (Table 1).\nThe \ufb01fty false-positive Ultra results included 13 previous\nTB cases. In 10/154 TB cases, Ultra lead to false-negative\nresults, and in all of them mycobacterial cultures identi\ufb01ed\nMTB growth.\n63/722 respiratory specimens presented trace results,\n\ufb01ve (7.9%) with con\ufb01rmed TB and 14 (22.2%) with non-con-\n\ufb01rmed TB. 10/44 cases classi\ufb01ed as not-TB had previous TB\n(Fig. 1). Therefore, Ultra was 93.5% sensitive and 91.2% spe-\nci\ufb01c. If trace results were considered as MTB not detected,\nsensitivity would fall to 81.1% with 98.9% of speci\ufb01city.\nWhether the previous history was taken into consideration\nfor classi\ufb01cation of trace as MTB not detected and attributed\nto DNA fragments of non-viable bacilli, sensitivity and speci-\n\ufb01city would be both 93.5%.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst study under\nroutine conditions and in a scenario of high prevalence of TB,\nas Brazil, that analyzes the performance of Ultra in such a large\nsample, which turn this letter innovative and informative.\nRecently, Xpert\u0001 MTB/RIF showed a good performance in\ndifferent\npulmonary\nspecimens,\nwith\nemphasis\nin\nIS\n(Acc=97%).3 In the present study, Ultra on IS had a sensitivity\nof 96.5% and a lower speci\ufb01city of 89.3%, which is compati-\nble with what the new version proposes. Considering the dif-\nferences between our sample and Zar\u2019s et al,4 which\naddresses a pediatric sample, Ultra also presented a better\nperformance on IS when compared to nasopharyngeal aspi-\nrate. Despite our results showing the greater accuracy on\nBAL, the performance of Ultra on IS deserves to be\nhighlighted, considering the costs and safety of the method,\nwhich can be substituted for BAL for TB diagnosis.\nFor Mazzola and colleagues,5 Ultra\u2019s proportion of true-\npositive results exceeds the false-positives: the latter being\navoidable in scenarios with a low pretest probability. In our\ncasuistry, considering only the false-positive results attrib-\nuted to previous TB history, 70.6% presented trace-results.\nIndependently of HIV-status, trace category increased\ncase detection by 2.1% without signi\ufb01cant loss of speci\ufb01city\nin the study of Andama et al.6 In our research, if trace-\nresults were considered negative in all cases, sensitivity\nwould fall to 81.1%, with a higher speci\ufb01city (98.9%). The\nother way, 44 cases would be false-positive, ten with previ-\nous TB. Therefore, if the history of previous pulmonary TB\nhad been evaluated, and Ultra trace result considered as\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2023.05.007\n2531-0437/\u00a9 2023 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

Two years ago we had a paucity of information on deal-\ning with such an unprecedented situation except for general\nrecommendations.1 Among these, in April 2020 an Italian\nposition paper considering different phases of the disease\nand organisational issues, has furnished detailed recommen-\ndations that have substantially contributed to the develop-\nment of safe and appropriate rehabilitative interventions\nparticularly for the provision of respiratory physiotherapy.2\nThe information released in that document is still valid and\nconsistent after two years. As already pointed out, from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic we have learned that physiotherapists\nalready substantially contributed to implementing appropri-\nate procedures and treatments at the beginning of the SARS-\nCoV-2 outbreak.3 However, at the time of writing, we have\nnow more data available, and we can infer additional details\nabout rehabilitation for patients with COVID-19 at different\nstages of the disease.TagedEnd\nTagedPCOVID-19 has several extrapulmonary manifestations of\nrehabilitative interest, including neurological, physical, and\nfunctional limitations4-7 which can last even months after\nthe acute illness phase.8,9 Over time, an increasing number\nof studies have been published reporting data about rehabil-\nitative therapies adopted and implemented in COVID-19 set-\ntings. Observational studies are con\ufb01rmed to be particularly\nhelpful during this COVID-19 pandemic since they allow\nresearchers to understand better different characteristics of\nthe disease and related rehabilitative treatments to be\nimplemented accordingly.10TagedEnd\nTagedPDuring the \ufb01rst pandemic wave, one of the most worrying\nconcerns was represented by hypercoagulability, a relevant\nfactor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 complications, with\npotential repercussions on the rehabilitative treatment.11TagedEnd\nTagedPThe surge in cases around the globe has stimulated easing\nadministrative procedures to transfer hospitalised COVID-19\npatients from acute COVID-19 hospitals to inpatient rehabili-\ntation facilities producing positive effects on availability of\nbeds.12 In addition, rehabilitation has played a crucial role\nTagedEndTagedPin facilitating patients\u2019 activity and mobility, a timely dis-\ncharge, and the possibility of being discharged home or to\n\u201cCovid hotels\u201d from acute hospitals.13 Several studies of\nacute inpatient rehabilitation conducted during the \ufb01rst\npandemic wave, have demonstrated that an early rehabilita-\ntive approach was effective at improving outcomes and\nfacilitating discharge to home.14-18 Nevertheless, the same\nef\ufb01cacy was not con\ufb01rmed when considering mortality;\nwhile in some studies rehabilitation was associated with\nreduced mortality,19 in others patients had a longer duration\nof invasive mechanical ventilation, a longer ICU stay, a more\nextended hospital stay and higher mortality rates.20 It could\nbe speculated that such differences are probably correlated\nto pre-existing comorbidities and patient selection.TagedEnd\nTagedPFrom data available in the literature, the rehabilitative\ntreatment provided in acute and subacute hospital settings\nseems to commence within the \ufb01rst 3-10 days after hospital\nadmission, to be constituted by 15/30-minute sessions hav-\ning heterogeneous frequencies ranging from twice a week to\na daily schedule.14-21TagedEnd\nTagedPAnother aspect emerging from different clinical experi-\nences is the use of assisted techniques implemented with\nrehabilitation such as muscle electrical stimulation and in-\nbed ergometry, showing they are feasible and contribute to\nreducing personnel exposure and saving personal protective\nequipment (PPE).15,22 Indeed, the availability of PPE was a\nprimary concern during the \ufb01rst pandemic wave. Although\nat the time of writing it seems there are no critical limita-\ntions to obtaining suf\ufb01cient quantities of PPE, their uninter-\nrupted use during the personnel shifts continues to be a\ncause of fatigue and attention, particularly regarding\nundressing and correct usage procedures.23 In addition,\nhigh-risk interventions such as patient pronation, oxygen\ntherapy, noninvasive ventilation, and chest physiotherapy,\ncontinue to be a matter of attention regarding personnel\nexposure. At the same time, manufacturers have been\nencouraged to develop a new generation of respiratory devi-\nces taking into consideration safety issues related to ventila-\ntion\nin\ncritical\nsettings\ndedicated\nto\npatients\nwith\nrespiratory viruses.24 To reduce personnel exposure and save\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2022.01.012\n2531-0437/\u00a9 2022 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

However, the most critical concern has been\nand still is \u0001at the time of writing\u0001 avoiding pressure on\nhealth care systems worldwide. In doing this, it is evident\nthat expediting patient \ufb02ow from acute to step-down units\nis a solution to making more beds available for those needing\ncare. Such an approach might be facilitated by treating\npatients as soon as they are hospitalised, sharing a culture\nof mobility within the care settings. In this context, acute\ninpatient rehabilitation is a valuable means of accomplishing\nthe mission to have patients participate in motor activities\nas much as possible and be able to execute respiratory exer-\ncises, even under challenging clinical conditions.25TagedEnd\nTagedPThe principal barriers to developing these abilities are\noften represented by the lack of human resources and the\nabsence of a mobility culture within the teams. Neverthe-\nless, these concerns can be addressed and observed from\nthree perspectives: patient, organisational structure, and\nprofessionals. For the patient, pre-existing daily autonomy,\ncare complexity and comorbidities are predictors of compli-\nance with the therapeutic measures and clinical outcomes.\nIt is well known that appropriate staf\ufb01ng, skill mix, training\nstrategies, and turnover of human resources can in\ufb02uence\nthe determination of the time reserved for patient assis-\ntance and the quality of multidisciplinary integration and\ncommunicative strategies between hospital settings. Fur-\nthermore, the effective management of the patients\u2019 clini-\ncal information contributes to enhancing the continuity of\ncare from acute to step-down units as well as from hospitals\nto territorial rehabilitative facilities.TagedEnd\nTagedPEventually, from the professional's point of view, sharing\ncommon schemes for preserving motor, respiratory, swallow-\ning functions should be implemented within the teams\nbecause they will in\ufb02uence the patients\u2019 journey to home or\npost-acute rehabilitative structures and expected out-\ncomes. Patients who do not require further hospitalisation\nin out-patient settings, but are still in need of care, can be\ndischarged home and continue to follow a speci\ufb01c rehabili-\ntative protocol via telerehabilitation. The COVID-19 pan-\ndemic has contributed to the development of telemedicine\nstrategies that are proving of crucial importance for reduc-\ning the risk of infection and responding to the need of care\nfor patients who, during the \ufb01rst pandemic wave, had no\naccess due to the contraction of healthcare services. Initial\nexperiences of telerehabilitation have demonstrated that it\nis feasible and produces positive effects on functional capac-\nity, exercise tolerance and dyspnoea.26TagedEnd\nTagedPHowever, one of the most positive aspects of the reha-\nbilitative pathway within critical settings is the capacity\nof sharing different tasks among health care professio-\nnals, involving various rehabilitation disciplines. In addi-\ntion,\nCOVID-19\nhas\nhighlighted\nthe\nability\nof\nteam\nmembers to cooperate, producing a virtuous circle of\nmultidisciplinarity.27,28 Last, but not least the published\nstudies\ndid\nnot\non\naverage\nreport\na\nhigh\nlevel\nof\nTagedEndTagedPcontamination among the rehabilitative staff, even in\nthose\nexposed\nto\naerosol-generating\nprocedures.29\nIndeed, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach\nis crucial to reducing the burden of care for families and\ncaregivers,\nexpediting patients\u2019 return to\nsocial\nand\nworking contexts, thus mitigating costs.TagedEnd\nTagedPAfter two years of COVID-19, we are observing that\nrehabilitation has several components that are \ufb01t to\naddress different phases of the disease. An early rehabili-\ntative approach in ICUs and sub-intensive settings has\nbeen demonstrated to be safe and feasible; to the same\nextent, patients developing long-COVID syndrome have\nfound a prompt response which is further implemented\nby telerehabilitation.TagedEnd\nTagedPWave after wave, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates\nthat health care systems are facing the same problems and\ndif\ufb01culties worldwide.

MSGP occurs more frequently in men who smoke\nand is commonly found in the left lingular segment.1 As\nthe majority of MSGPs present with a lung mass on the\nCT image,2 endobronchial presentation of this MSGP is\nuncommon.

                "text": "LETTER TO THE EDITOR\nLung disease in rheumatoid\narthritis: Results from a national\ncohort\nDear Editor,\nLung involvement can occur in 10\u000180% of rheumatoid arthri-\ntis (RA) patients,1,2 mostly within the \ufb01rst 5 years of RA diag-\nnosis.1 It includes interstitial lung disease (ILD), airways\ndisease, pleural disease and nodules.1 Pulmonary hyperten-\nsion and direct toxicity from RA therapy have also been\ndescribed.1\nDespite therapeutic advances,2 lung disease remains\nresponsible for 10\u000120% of RA mortality.1\nThis\nobservational,\nretrospective,\nmulticenter\nstudy\ncharacterizes lung involvement in a nationwide cohort of RA\npatients, identi\ufb01es factors associated with lung disease and\ndescribes treatments used in patients with RA-ILD. All RA\npatients aged \u000118 years at diagnosis prospectively followed\nin Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Registry (Reuma.pt) were\nincluded from 2008 to February 2022.\nLung involvement diagnosis was based on high resolution\ncomputed tomography (CT) and/or histopathological data.\nThe date of the exam was considered the date of lung dis-\nease diagnosis. Demographics and clinical data, including\nsmoking habits, RA duration, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-\ncitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), secondary Sj\u20acogren\u2019s\nsyndrome (SS2) and subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, were\nretrieved at last visit. Erosive disease was based on X-rays\nperformed at any time. Current/previous disease modifying\nantirheumatic\ndrugs\n(DMARDs)\nand\nanti\ufb01brotics\nwere\nrecorded. Missing information was \ufb01lled in from hospital\nrecords, whenever possible.\nContinuous variables were expressed as mean \u00a7 S.D. or\nmedian with interquartile range (IQR) and categorical varia-\nbles as absolute values and frequencies. Groups were com-\npared using qui-square test and independent samples t test\nor Mann\u0001Whitney test, as appropriate. Statistically signi\ufb01-\ncantly different variables were included in a logistic regres-\nsion\nanalysis\nfor\nidentifying\nfeatures\nindependently\nassociated with lung disease. A signi\ufb01cance level of 5% was\nconsidered. SPSS version 28.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA)\nwas used. The study was approved by the Coordinator and\nScienti\ufb01c Board of Reuma.pt and by the Ethics Committee of\nHospital Garcia de Orta. All data registered on Reuma.pt is\nsubjected to an informed consent signed by the patient.\nFrom 9415 RA patients registered in Reuma.pt, 7473\n(79.4%) were female, with mean age of 62.3 \u00a7 13.6 years\nand median disease duration of 12.4 [IQR 6.5\u000120.6] years at\nlast visit.\nLung disease was documented in 298 (3.2%) patients. The\nmedian interval between joint and pulmonary symptoms\nwas 5 [IQR 1\u000115] years. Twenty-one (7.8%; 28 missing data)\npatients had lung disease as \ufb01rst manifestation.\nFig. 1 shows the distribution of different types of lung\ninvolvement. Thirteen patients had more than one type of\nlung involvement. None of the patients with rheumatoid\nlung nodules had subcutaneous nodules. Two patients with\nCT showing peribronchial micronodules and a \ufb02uffy \u201ctree-in-\nbud pattern\u201d had lung biopsy, which documented follicular\nbronchiolitis.\nTable 1 shows clinical characteristics of patients with and\nwithout lung involvement.\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean \u00a7 S.D. if they\nhad a normal distribution, or median with interquartile\nrange (IQR) if not normally distributed. Categorical variables\nare presented as absolute values (n) and frequencies (%).\nIn\nmultivariate\nanalysis,\never\nsmoking\n(OR\n=\n2.1;\n[95%CI:1.4\u00013.9], p < 0.001), positive ACPA (OR = 2.1;\n[95%CI:1.2\u00013.6], p = 0.002) and older age (OR = 1.05 per\nyear; [95%CI:1.03\u00011.07], p < 0.001) were positively associ-\nated with lung disease, whereas previous treatment with\nmethotrexate\n(MTX)\n(OR\n=\n0.32;\n[95%CI:0.22\u00010.46],\np < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)\n(OR = 0.48; [95%CI: 0.32\u00010.7], p < 0.001) had a negative\nassociation with RA-associated lung disease.\nAt lung disease diagnosis, 169 (56.7%) patients were tak-\ning MTX, 131 (44%) other conventional synthetic DMARDs, 49\n(16.4%) TNFi, 13 (4.4%) tocilizumab, 9 (3%) rituximab, 2\n(0.7%) abatacept and 2 (0.7%) Janus Kinase inhibitors. After\nlung disease diagnosis, 77 out of 169 patients (45.6%) were\nkept under MTX.\nAfter ILD diagnosis, rituximab became the most pre-\nscribed biologic, in 62 (34.1%) patients, followed by toci-\nlizumab (15 patients; 8.2%) and abatacept (7 patients;\n3.8%). TNFi were used in 16 (8.8%) patients. Twelve RA-\nILD patients received anti\ufb01brotics (6 nintedanib, 6 pirfe-\nnidone).\nThe involvement of several centers explains why the number of 6\nauthors has been exceeded.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2023.05.009\n2531-0437/\u00a9 2023 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

                "text": "The proportion of RA patients with lung involvement in\nour cohort was lower than that reported in the literature,1\nwhich might be explained by underreporting in Reuma.pt\nand because in most cases lung disease was only screened\nafter respiratory symptoms developed. High-resolution CT is\nnow considered the gold-standard for diagnosis. Lung biopsy\nis only performed when imaging features are inconclusive or\nwhen the etiology of lung disease is unclear.1,2\nBesides, taking into consideration the pathogenic role of\nRA-related autoantibodies, smoking and occupational dust\nin RA-associated lung disease1,3 and the fact that articular\ndisease activity seems to be higher in patients with RA-ILD,1\nthe lower smoking prevalence rates in Portugal compared to\nother European countries4 and the lower aggressiveness of\nRA in southern Europe than in other geographic areas5 can\nalso contribute to the lower prevalence of RA-associated\nlung disease in our cohort. In 7.8% of RA patients, lung dis-\nease was the \ufb01rst disease manifestation, with recent data\nsuggesting that the lung may be a potential mucosal site of\ngeneration of RA-related autoimmunity.3\nRA-ILD was the most prevalent type of lung involvement\n(70.1% of the patients with lung disease), which is in line\nwith published data.1\nPatients with RA-associated lung disease had a higher fre-\nquency of smoking habits, positive RF and ACPA and erosive\ndisease, consistent with the literature.1,3 However, 24\npatients with lung disease were negative for RF and ACPA,\nwith only 2 having smoking habits. This means that other\nfactors may contribute to lung disease development.\nData on MTX and others DMARDs causing/worsening pre-\nexisting ILD in RA patients is controversial,2,6 with recent\ndata demonstrating that controlling systemic in\ufb02ammation\ncan delay/prevent RA-ILD development.3\nDespite being a retrospective study, this constitutes an\nextensive characterization of a considerable number of RA\npatients with lung involvement and con\ufb01rms the reproduc-\nibility of classic risk factors for lung disease7 in a national\ncohort. In the future, the identi\ufb01cation of new risk factors\nand the validation of risk scores, could help identify patients\nat high risk of RA-associated lung disease that might bene\ufb01t\nfrom a screening strategy including an HRCT at disease diag-\nnosis, similar to what is already recommended for systemic\nsclerosis.8\nCon\ufb02icts of interest\nAll authors declare no competing interests.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any speci\ufb01c grant from funding\nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-pro\ufb01t sec-\ntors.\nFig. 1\nDistribution of the different types of lung involvement\nin RA patients.\nTable 1\nComparison of clinical characteristics between patients with and without lung involvement.\nWith lung involvement\n(N = 298)\nWithout lung\ninvolvement (N = 9117)\nPercentage of\nmissing data\np-value\nMale\n89 (29.9%)\n1853 (20.3%)\n0%\n<0.001\nAge (years)\n69.4 \u00a7 10.5\n62.2 \u00a7 13.7\n0%\n<0.001\nRA duration (years)\n13.6 [IQR 7\u000122.8]\n12.3 [IQR 6.5\u000120.5]\n20.8%\n0.066\nEver smoking\n90 (30.2%)\n1419 (15.6%)\n40.6%\n<0.001\nOccupational exposure\nrisk\n38 (12.8%)\n625 (6.9%)\n61.2%\n0.327\nPositive RF\n228 (76.5%)\n4783 (52.5%)\n24.5%\n<0.001\nPositive ACPA\n217 (72.8%)\n3802 (41.7%)\n38%\n<0.001\nErosive disease\n155 (52%)\n3171 (34.8%)\n40.7%\n0.058\nSS2\n22 (7.4%)\n329 (3.6%)\n46.8%\n0.815\nPrevious treatment with\nMTX\n169 (56.7%)\n6112 (82.5%)\n18.8%\n<0.001\nPrevious treatment with\nTNFi\n49 (20.3%)\n2989 (40.4%)\n18.8%\n< 0.001\nRA, rheumatoid arthritis; RF, rheumatoid factor; ACPA, anti-citrullinated peptide antibody; SS2, secondary Sj\u20acogren\u2019s syndrome; MTX,\nmethotrexate; TNFi, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.\n88\nA.C.
